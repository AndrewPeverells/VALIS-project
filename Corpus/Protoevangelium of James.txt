"PROTOEVANGELIUM BOOK OF JAMES OR PROTEVANGELIUM I In the histories of the twelve tribes of Israel it is written that there was one Ioacim exceeding rich and he offered his gifts twofold saying That which is of my superfluity shall be for the whole people and that which is for my forgiveness shall be for the Lord for a propitiation unto me Now the great day of the Lord drew nigh and the children of Israel offered their gifts And Reuben stood over against him saying It is not lawful for thee to offer thy gifts first forasmuch as thou hast gotten no seed in Israel And Ioacim was sore grieved and went unto the record of the twelve tribes of the people saying I will look upon the record of the twelve tribes of Israel whether I only have not gotten seed in Israel And he searched and found concerning all the righteous that they had raised up seed in Israel And he remembered the patriarch Abraham how in the last days God gave him a son even Isaac And Ioacim was sore grieved and showed not himself to his wife but betook himself into the wilderness and pitched his tent there and fasted forty days and forty nights saying within himself I will not go down either for meat or for drink until the Lord my God visit me and my prayer shall be unto me meat and drink II Now his wife Anna lamented with two lamentations and bewailed herself with two bewailings saying I will bewail my widowhood and I will bewail my childlessness And the great day of the Lord drew nigh and Judith her handmaid said unto her How long humblest thou thy soul The great day of the Lord hath come and it is not lawful for thee to mourn but take this headband which the mistress of my work gave me and it is not lawful for me to put it on forasmuch as I am an handmaid and it hath a mark of royalty And Anna said Get thee from me Lo I have done nothing and the Lord hath greatly humbled me peradventure one gave it to thee in subtilty and thou art come to make me partaker in thy sin And Judith said How shall I curse thee seeing the Lord hath shut up thy womb to give thee no fruit in Israel And Anna was sore grieved And she put off her mourning garments and cleansed her head and put on her bridal garments and about the ninth hour she went down into the garden to walk there And she saw a laurel tree and sat down underneath it and besought the Lord saying O God of our fathers bless me and hearken unto my prayer as thou didst bless the womb of Sarah and gavest her a son even Isaac III And looking up to the heaven she espied a nest of sparrows in the laurel tree and made a lamentation within herself saying Woe unto me who begat me And what womb brought me forth for I am become a curse before the children of Israel and I am reproached and they have mocked me forth out of the temple of the Lord Woe unto me unto what am I likened Iam not likened unto the fowls of the heaven for even the fowls of the heaven are fruitful before thee O Lord Woe unto me unto what am I likened I am not likened unto the beasts of the earth for even the beasts of the earth are fruitful before thee O Lord Woe unto me unto what am I likened I am not likened unto these waters for even these waters are fruitful before thee O Lord Woe unto me unto what am I likened I am not likened unto this earth for even this earth bringeth forth her fruits in due season and blesseth thee O Lord IV And behold an angel of the Lord appeared saying unto her Anna Anna the Lord hath hearkened unto thy prayer and thou shalt conceive and bear and thy seed shall be spoken of in the whole world And Anna said As the Lord my God liveth if I bring forth either male or female I will bring it for a gift unto the Lord my God and it shall be ministering unto him all the days of its life And behold there came two messengers saying unto her Behold Ioacim thy husband cometh with his flocks for an angel of the Lord came down unto him saying Ioacim Ioacim the Lord God hath hearkened unto thy prayer Get thee down hence for behold thy wife Anna shall conceive And Ioacim gat him down and called his herdsmen saying Bring me hither ten lambs without blemish and without spot and they shall be for the Lord my God and bring me twelve tender calves and they shall be for the priests and for the assembly of the elders and an hundred kids for the whole people And behold Ioacim came with his flocks and Anna stood at the gate and saw Ioacim coming and ran and hung upon his neck saying Now know I that the Lord God hath greatly blessed me for behold the widow is no more a widow and she that was childless shall conceive And Ioacim rested the first day in his house V And on the morrow he offered his gifts saying in himself If the Lord God be reconciled unto me the plate that is upon the forehead of the priest will make it manifest unto me And Ioacim offered his gifts and looked earnestly upon the plate of the priest when he went up unto the altar of the Lord and he saw no sin in himself And Ioacim said Now know I that the Lord is become propitious unto me and hath forgiven all my sins And he went down from the temple of the Lord justified and went unto his house And her months were fulfilled and in the ninth month Anna brought forth And she said unto the midwife What have I brought forth And she said A female And Anna said My soul is magnified this day and she laid herself down And when the days were fulfilled Anna purified herself and gave suck to the child and called her name Mary VI And day by day the child waxed strong and when she was six months old her mother stood her upon the ground to try if she would stand and she walked seven steps and returned unto her bosom And she caught her up saying As the Lord my God liveth thou shalt walk no more upon this ground until I bring thee into the temple of the Lord And she made a sanctuary in her bedchamber and suffered nothing common or unclean to pass through it And she called for the daughters of the Hebrews that were undefiled and they carried her hither and thither And the first year of the child was fulfilled and Ioacim made a great feast and bade the priests and the scribes and the assembly of the elders and the whole people of Israel And Ioacim brought the child to the priests and they blessed her saying O God of our fathers bless this child and give her a name renowned for ever among all generations And all the people said So be it so be it Amen And he brought her to the high priests and they blessed her saying O God of the high places look upon this child and bless her with the last blessing which hath no successor And her mother caught her up into the sanctuary of her bedchamber and gave her suck And Anna made a song unto the Lord God saying I will sing an hymn unto the Lord my God because he hath visited me and taken away from me the reproach of mine enemies and the Lord hath given me a fruit of his righteousness single and manifold before him Who shall declare unto the sons of Reuben that Anna giveth suck Hearken hearken ye twelve tribes of Israel that Anna giveth suck And she laid the child to rest in the bedchamber of her sanctuary and went forth and ministered unto them And when the feast was ended they gat them down rejoicing and glorifying the God of Israel VII And unto the child her months were added and the child became two years old And Ioacim said Let us bring her up to the temple of the Lord that we may pay the promise which we promised lest the Lord require it of us and our gift become unacceptable And Anna said Let us wait until the third year that the child may not long after her father or mother And Ioacim said Let us wait And the child became three years old and Ioacim said Call for the daughters of the Hebrews that are undefiled and let them take every one a lamp and let them be burning that the child turn not backward and her heart be taken captive away from the temple of the Lord And they did so until they were gone up into the temple of the Lord And the priest received her and kissed her and blessed her and said The Lord hath magnified thy name among all generations in thee in the latter days shall the Lord make manifest his redemption unto the children of Israel And he made her to sit upon the third step of the altar And the Lord put grace upon her and she danced with her feet and all the house of Israel loved her VIII And her parents gat them down marvelling and praising the Lord God because the child was not turned away backward And Mary was in the temple of the Lord as a dove that is nurtured and she received food from the hand of an angel And when she was twelve years old there was a council of the priests saying Behold Mary is become twelve years old in the temple of the Lord What then shall we do with her lest she pollute the sanctuary of the Lord And they said unto the high priest Thou standest over the altar of the Lord Enter in and pray concerning her And whatsoever the Lord shall reveal to thee that let us do And the high priest took the vestment with the twelve bells and went in unto the Holy of Holies and prayed concerning her And lo an angel of the Lord appeared saying unto him Zacharias Zacharias go forth and assemble them that are widowers of the people and let them bring every man a rod and to whomsoever the Lord shall show a sign his wife shall she be And the heralds went forth over all the country round about Judaea and the trumpet of the Lord sounded and all men ran thereto IX And Joseph cast down his adze and ran to meet them and when they were gathered together they went to the high priest and took their rods with them And he took the rods of them all and went into the temple and prayed And when he had finished the prayer he took the rods and went forth and gave them back to them and there was no sign upon them But Joseph received the last rod and lo a dove came forth of the rod and flew upon the head of Joseph And the priest said unto Joseph Unto thee hath it fallen to take the virgin of the Lord and keep her for thyself And Joseph refused saying I have sons and I am an old man but she is a girl lest I became a laughing stock to the children of Israel And the priest said unto Joseph Fear the Lord thy God and remember what things God did unto Dathan and Abiram and Korah how the earth clave and they were swallowed up because of their gainsaying And now fear thou Joseph lest it beso in thine house And Joseph was afraid and took her to keep her for himself And Joseph said unto Mary Lo I have received thee out of the temple of the Lord and now do I leave thee in my house and I go away to build my buildings and I will come again unto thee The Lord shall watch over thee X Now there was a council of the priests and they said Let us make a veil for the temple of the Lord And the priest said Call unto me pure virgins of the tribe of David And the officers departed and sought and found seven virgins And the priests called to mind the child Mary that she was of the tribe of David and was undefiled before God and the officers went and fetched her And they brought them into the temple of the Lord and the priest said Cast me lots which of you shall weave the gold and the undefiled and the fine linen and the silk and the hyacinthine and the scarlet and the true purple And the lot of the true purple and the scarlet fell unto Mary and she took them and went unto her house But Mary took the scarlet and began to spin it XI And she took the pitcher and went forth to fill it with water and lo a voice saying Hail thou that art highly favoured the Lord is with thee blessed art thou among women And she looked about her upon the right hand and upon the pve left to see whence this voice should be and being filled with trembling she went to her house and set down the pitcher and took the purple and sat down upon her seat and drew out the thread And behold an angel of the Lord stood before her saying Fear not Mary for thou hast found grace before the Lord of all things and thou shalt conceive of his word And she when she heard it questioned in herself saying Shall I verily conceive of the living God and bring forth after the manner of ail women And the angel of the Lord said Not so Mary for a power of the Lord shall overshadow thee wherefore also that holy thing which shall be born of thee shall be called the Son of the Highest And thou shalt call his name Jesus for he shall save his people from their sins And Mary said Behold the handmaid of the Lord is before him be it unto me according to thy word XII And she made the purple and the scarlet and brought them unto the priest And the priest blessed her and said Mary the Lord God hath magnified thy name and thou shalt be blessed among all generations of the earth And Mary rejoiced and went away unto Elizabeth her kinswoman and she knocked at the door And Elizabeth when she heard it cast down the scarlet and ran to the door and opened it and when she saw Mary she blessed her and said Whence is this to me that the mother of my Lord should come unto me for behold that which is in me leaped and blessed thee And Mary forgat the mysteries which Gabriel the archangel had told her and she looked up unto the heaven and said Who am I Lord that all the generations of the earth do bless me And she abode three months with Elizabeth and day by day her womb grew and Mary was afraid and departed unto her house and hid herself from the children of Israel Now she was sixteen years old when these mysteries came to pass XIII Now it was the sixth month with her and behold Joseph came from his building and he entered into his house and found her great with child And he smote his face and cast himself down upon the ground on sackcloth and wept bitterly saying With what countenance shall I look unto the Lord my God and what prayer shall I make concerning this maiden for I received her out of the temple of the Lord my God a virgin and have not kept her safe Who is he that hath ensnared me Who hath done this evil in mine house and hath defiled the virgin Is not the story of Adam repeated in me for as at the hour of his giving thanks the serpent came and found Eve alone and deceived her so hath it befallen me also And Joseph arose from off the sackcloth and called Mary and said unto her O thou that wast cared for by God why hast thou done this thou hast forgotten the Lord thy God Why hast thou humbled thy soul thou that wast nourished up in the Holy of Holies and didst receive food at the hand of an angel But she wept bitterly saying I am pure and I know not a man And Joseph said unto her Whence then is that which is in thy womb and she said As the Lord my God liveth I know not whence it is come unto me XIV And Joseph was sore afraid and ceased from speaking unto her and pondered what he should do with her And Joseph said If I hide her sin I shall be found fighting against the law of the Lord and if I manifest her unto the children of Israel I fear lest that which is in her be the seed of an angel and I shall be found delivering up innocent blood to the judgement of death What then shall I do I will let her go from me privily And the night came upon him And behold an angel of the Lord appeared unto him in a dream saying Fear not this child for that which is in her is of the Holy Ghost and she shall bear a son and thou shalt call his name Jesus for he shall save his people from their sins And Joseph arose from sleep and glorified the God of Israel which had shown this favour unto her and he watched over her XV Now Annas the scribe came unto him and said to him Wherefore didst thou not appear in our assembly and Joseph said unto him I was weary with the journey and I rested the first day And Annas turned him about and saw Mary great with child And he went hastily to the priest and said unto him Joseph to whom thou bearest witness hath sinned grievously And the priest said Wherein And he said The virgin whom he received out of the temple of the Lord he hath defiled her and married her by stealth and hath not declared it to the children of Israel And the priest answered and said Hath Joseph done this And Annas the scribe said Send officers and thou shalt find the virgin great with child And the officers went and found as he had said and they brought her together with Joseph unto the place of judgement And the priest said Mary wherefore hast thou done this and wherefore hast thou humbled thy soul and forgotten the Lord thy God thou that wast nurtured in the Holy of Holies and didst receive food at the hand of an angel and didst hear the hymns and didst dance before the Lord wherefore hast thou done this But she wept bitterly saying As the Lord my God liveth I am pure before him and I know not a man And the priest said unto Joseph Wherefore hast thou done this And Joseph said As the Lord my God liveth I am pure as concerning her And the priest said Bear no false witness but speak the truth thou hast married her by stealth and hast not declared it unto the children of Israel and hast not bowed thine head under the mighty hand that thy seed should be blessed And Joseph held his peace XVI And the priest said Restore the virgin whom thou didst receive out of the temple of the Lord And Joseph was full of weeping And the priest said I will give you to drink of the water of the conviction of the Lord and it will make manifest your sins before your eyes And the priest took thereof and made Joseph drink and sent him into the hill country And he returned whole He made Mary also drink and sent her into the hill country And she returned whole And all the people marvelled because sin appeared not in them And the priest said If the Lord God hath not made your sin manifest neither do I condemn you And he let them go And Joseph took Mary and departed unto his house rejoicing and glorifying the God of Israel XVII Now there went out a decree from Augustus the king that all that were in Bethlehem of Judaea should be recorded And Joseph said I will record my sons but this child what shall I do with her how shall I record her as my wife nay I am ashamed Or as my daughter but all the children of Israel know that she is not my daughter This day of the Lord shall do as the Lord willeth And he saddled the she ass and set her upon it and his son led it and Joseph followed after And they drew near within three miles and Joseph turned himself about and saw her of a sad countenance and said within himself Peradventure that which is within her paineth her And again Joseph turned himself about and saw her laughing and said unto her Mary what aileth thee that I see thy face at one time laughing and at another time sad And Mary said unto Joseph It is because I behold two peoples with mine eyes the one weeping and lamenting and the other rejoicing and exulting And they came to the midst of the way and Mary said unto him Take me down from the ass for that which is within me presseth me to come forth And he took her down from the ass and said unto her Whither shall I take thee to hide thy shame for the place is desert XVIII And he found a cave there and brought her into it and set his sons by her and he went forth and sought for a midwife of the Hebrews in the country of Bethlehem Now I Joseph was walking and I walked not And I looked up to the air and saw the air in amazement And I looked up unto the pole of the heaven and saw it standing still and the fowls of the heaven without motion And I looked upon the earth and saw a dish set and workmen lying by it and their hands were in the dish and they that were chewing chewed not and they that were lifting the food lifted it not and they that put it to their mouth put it not thereto but the faces of all of them were looking upward And behold there were sheep being driven and they went not forward but stood still and the shepherd lifted his hand to smite them with his staff and his hand remained up And I looked upon the stream of the river and saw the mouths of the kids upon the water and they drank not And of a sudden all things moved onward in their course XIX And behold a woman coming down from the hillcountry and she said to me Man whither goest thou And I said I seek a midwife of the Hebrews And she answered and said unto me Art thou of Israel And I said unto her Yea And she said And who is she that bringeth forth in the cave And I said She that is betrothed unto me And she said to me Is she not thy wife And I said to her It is Mary that was nurtured up in the temple of the Lord and I received her to wife by lot and she is not my wife but she hath conception by the Holy Ghost And the midwife said unto him Is this the truth And Joseph said unto her Come hither and see And the midwife went with him And they stood in the place of the cave and behold a bright cloud overshadowing the cave And the midwife said My soul is magnified this day because mine eyes have seen marvellous things for salvation is born unto Israel And immediately the cloud withdrew itself out of the cave and a great light appeared in the cave so that our eyes could not endure it And by little and little that light withdrew itself until the young child appeared and it went and took the breast of its mother Mary And the midwife cried aloud and said Great unto me to day is this day in that I have seen this new sight And the midwife went forth of the cave and Salome met her And she said to her Salome Salome a new sight have I to tell thee A virgin hath brought forth which her nature alloweth not And Salome said As the Lord my God liveth if I make not trial and prove her nature I will not believe that a virgin hath brought forth XX And the midwife went in and said unto Mary Order thyself for there is no small contention arisen concerning thee And Salome made trial and cried out and said Woe unto mine iniquity and mine unbelief because I have tempted the living God and lo my hand falleth away from me in fire And she bowed her knees unto the Lord saying O God of my fathers remember that I am the seed of Abraham and Isaac and Jacob make me not a public example unto the children of Israel but restore me unto the poor for thou knowest Lord that in thy name did I perform my cures and did receive my hire of thee And lo an angel of the Lord appeared saying unto her Salome Salome the Lord hath hearkened to thee bring thine hand near unto the young child and take him up and there shall be unto thee salvation and joy And Salome came near and took him up saying I will do him worship for a great king is born unto Israel And behold immediately Salome was healed and she went forth of the cave justified And lo a voice saying Salome Salome tell none of the marvels which thou hast seen until the child enter into Jerusalem XXI And behold Joseph made him ready to go forth into Judaea And there came a great tumult in Bethlehem of Judaea for there came wise men saying Where is he that is born king of the Jews for we have seen his star in the east and are come to worship him And when Herod heard it he was troubled and sent officers unto the wise men And he sent for the high priests and examined them saying How is it written concerning the Christ where he is born They say unto him In Bethlehem of Judaea for so it is written And he let them go And he examined the wise men saying unto them What sign saw ye concerning the king that is born And the wise men said We saw a very great star shining among those stars and dimming them so that the stars appeared not and thereby knew we that a king was born unto Israel and we came to worship him And Herod said Go and seek for him and if ye find him tell me that I also may come and worship him And the wise men went forth And lo the star which they saw in the east went before them until they entered into the cave and it stood over the head of the cave And the wise men saw the young child with Mary his mother and they brought out of their scrip gifts gold and frankincense and myrrh And being warned by the angel that they should not enter into Judaea they went into their own country by another way XXII But when Herod perceived that he was mocked by the wise men he was wroth and sent murderers saying unto them Slay the children from two years old and under And when Mary heard that the children were being slain she was afraid and took the young child and wrapped him in swaddling clothes and laid him in an ox manger But Elizabeth when she heard that they sought for John took him and went up into the hill country and looked about her where she should hide him and there was no hiding place And Elizabeth groaned and said with a loud voice O mountain of God receive thou a mother with a child For Elizabeth was not able to go up And immediately the mountain clave asunder and took her in And there was a light shining alway for them for an angel of the Lord was with them keeping watch over them XXIII Now Herod sought for John and sent officers to Zacharias saying Where hast thou hidden thy son And he answered and said unto them I am a minister of God and attend continually upon the temple of the Lord I know not where my son is And the officers departed and told Herod all these things And Herod was wroth and said His son is to be king over Israel And he sent unto him again saying Say the truth where is thy son for thou knowest that thy blood is under my hand And the officers departed and told him all these things And Zacharias said I am a martyr of God if thou sheddest my blood for my spirit the Lord shall receive because thou sheddest innocent blood in the fore court of the temple of the Lord And about the dawning of the day Zacharias was slain And the children of Israel knew not that he was slain XXIV But the priests entered in at the hour of the saluta tion and the blessing of Zacharias met them not according to the manner And the priests stood waiting for Zacharias to salute him with the prayer and to glorify the Most High But as he delayed to come they were all afraid and one of them took courage and entered in and he saw beside the altar congealed blood and a voice saying Zacharias hath been slain and his blood shall not be wiped out until his avenger come And when he heard that word he was afraid and went forth and told the priests And they took courage and went in and saw that which was done and the panels of the temple did wail and they renttheir clothes from the top to the bottom And his body they found not but his blood they found turned into stone And they feared and went forth and told all the people that Zacharias was slain And all the tribes of the people heard it and they mourned for him and lamented him three days and three nights And after the three days the priests took counsel whom they should set in his stead and the lot came up upon Symeon Now he it was which was warned by the Holy Ghost that he should not see death until he should see the Christ in the flesh XXV Now I James which wrote this history in Jerusalem when there arose a tumult when Herod died withdrew myself into the wilderness until the tumult ceased in Jerusalem Glorifying the Lord God which gave me the gift and the wisdom to write this history And grace shall be with those that fear our Lord Jesus Christ to whom be glory for ever and ever Amen INFANCY GOSPEL OF THOMAS I Thomas the Israelite am reporting to you all my brothers from the nations to reveal the childhood and the greatness of our Lord Jesus Christ what he did in my country after he was born This is the beginning of it Chapter When the boy Jesus was five years old he was playing in a narrow part of a rushing stream He was gathering the flowing waters into ponds and immediately they were made clean and he ordered these things with a single word And after he made clay he molded twelve sparrows from it And it was the Sabbath when he did these things But there were also many other children playing with him Then a certain Jew saw what Jesus was doing while playing on the Sabbath Immediately he departed and reported to Jesus father Joseph Look your child is in the stream and he took clay and formed twelve birds and profaned the Sabbath And Joseph went to the area and when he saw him he shouted Why are you doing these things that are not permitted on the Sabbath Jesus however clapped his hands and shouted to the sparrows Depart fly and remember me now that you are alive And the sparrows departed shrieking When the Jews saw this they were amazed After they had gone away they described to their leaders what they had seen Jesus do Chapter The son of Annas the scribe was standing there with Jesus Taking a branch from a willow tree he dispersed the waters which Jesus had gathered When Jesus saw what had happened he became angry and said to him You godless brainless moron what did the ponds and waters do to you Watch this now you are going to dry up like a tree and you will never produce leaves or roots or fruit And immediately this child withered up completely Then Jesus departed and returned to Joseph s house The parents of the one who had been withered up however wailed for their young child as they took his remains away Then they went to Joseph and accused him You are responsible for the child who did this Chapter Next he was going through the village again and a running child bumped his shoulder Becoming bitter Jesus said to him You will not complete your journey Immediately he fell down and died Then some of the people who had seen what had happened said Where has this child come from so that his every word is a completed deed And going to Joseph the parents of the one who had died found fault with him They said Because you have such a child you are not allowed to live with us in the village or at least teach him to bless and not curse For our children are dead Chapter And taking his child aside he warned him saying Why are you doing these things These people are suffering and they hate us and cause trouble for us Then Jesus said I know that the words I speak are not mine Nevertheless I will be silent for your sake but these people will bear their punishment And immediately his accusers became blind When they saw what he had done they were extremely afraid and did not know what to do And they talked about him saying Every word he speaks good or evil is an event and becomes a miracle When Joseph saw that Jesus had done this however he was outraged and took his ear and pulled it extremely hard Then the child became angry and said to him It is enough for you to seek and not find but too much for you to act so unwisely Do you not know that I am not yours Do not trouble me Chapter A teacher named Zacchaeus overheard everything Jesus said to Joseph and marveled saying to himself As just a child he utters these things And taking Joseph aside he said to him You have a wise child he has a good mind but give him to me that he may learn letters I will teach him all knowledge so that he will not be rebellious Replying Joseph said to him Nobody except God can subordinate this child Do not consider him to be a small cross brother As Jesus heard Joseph saying this he laughed and said to Zacchaeus Really teacher what my father has said to you is true I am the Lord of this people and am here in your presence and have been born among you and am with you I know where you are from and how many years there will be in your lives I am telling you the truth teacher when you were born I existed And if you want to be a perfect teacher listen to me and I will teach you wisdom which nobody knows except me and the one who sent me to you For you are my disciple and I know you how old you are and how old you will live to be And when you see the cross my father has described you will believe that everything I have said to you is true Then the Jews who were present and heard Jesus were amazed and said What a strange and remarkable event The child is only five years old and already he says such things For we never heard anyone who speaks words like this child does Replying to them Jesus said Are you so amazed Then you should believe more of what I said to you I really also know when you and your parents were born and I will tell you this remarkable fact even when the world was created I and the one who sent me to you existed When the Jews heard the child say this however it made them angry even though they were not able to reply to his speech Then the child came forward and leaping toward them he said I taunted you For I know that you are amazed by little things and have minuscule minds Since they thought they were being consoled by the child s exhortation the teacher said to Joseph Lead him to the school and I will teach him letters So Joseph took him by the hand and led him into the classroom And the teacher wrote the alphabet for him and began to practice it many times but the child said nothing and did not answer him for a long time Becoming outraged the teacher hit him on the head After enduring this stoically the child said to him I am teaching you more than being taught by you because I know the letters you are teaching me and your judgment is great These things are to you like a copper pitcher or a clashing cymbal which do not offer glory or wisdom through sound Nobody understands the power of my wisdom Then when his rage was finished he said the alphabet from alpha to omega very quickly Looking the teacher in the face he told him Since you do not know the nature of the alpha how are going to teach me the beta Hypocrite if you know first teach me the alpha then I will believe what you say about the beta Then he began to tell the teacher about the first letter And the teacher was not strong enough to say anything Then while many were listening he said to Zacchaeus Listen teacher and observe the structure of the first letter how it has two standard lines and impresses coming to a point in the middle and remaining there coming together lifting up dancing having three corners having two corners without strokes of one family well balanced as long as the alpha has equal lines Chapter When Zacchaeus heard such great words and allegories of this sort about the first letter from the child he was at a loss over what his defense and teaching could be And he said to those present Oh me I am suffering and at a loss and am ashamed of myself because I took this child So take him I urge you brother Joseph I am not able to bear his stare or his direct speech This child was not born of the earth he is even able to subdue fire Perhaps he was born before the creation of the world What womb bore him what sort of mother brought him up I know not Oh me friends I am going out of my mind I deceived myself and am suffering unimaginably I struggled to have a student and I have found that I have a teacher Brothers consider the shame an experienced leader has been conquered by a child And I may have to lose heart and die because of this child For at this very hour I am not able to look him in the eye When everyone says that I have been conquered by a child what can I say And what more is there to say about the lines of the first letter than what he already told me I do not know So I beg you brother Joseph take him to your house Whether I should call him a god or an angel or something else I do not know Chapter While the Jews were advising Zacchaeus the child had a great laugh and said Now the fruitless bear fruit and the blind see and the deaf in the understanding of the heart hear I am here from above that I may rescue those below and call them to higher things just as the one who sent me to you commanded me And when the child completed his speech those who were under his curse were immediately saved but from then on nobody dared to make him angry because they did not want to be cursed or crippled Chapter And after a few days passed Jesus was up on a roof of a house And one of the children playing with him died after falling off the roof And when the other children saw they fled and Jesus was left standing alone When the parents of the one who had died came they accused Jesus Troublemaker you threw him down But Jesus replied I did not throw him down rather he threw himself down When he was not acting carefully he leaped off the roof and died Jesus leaped off the roof and stood by the corpse of the boy and cried out with a loud voice and said Zeno for that was his name rise up talk to me did I throw you down And rising up immediately he said No Lord you did not throw me down but you did raise me up And when they saw this they were overwhelmed The parents of the child glorified God on account of the sign which had happened and they worshipped Jesus Chapter A short number of days later when a certain young man was splitting wood in the neighborhood his ax fell and cut through the bottom of his foot As it became bloodless he was dying Then there was a great clamor and a crowd formed and the child Jesus ran there And forcing his way through the crowd he went and seized the young man s wounded foot Immediately it was healed Then he said to the young man Get up now chop the wood and remember me When the crowd saw what had happened they worshipped the child saying Truly the spirit of God dwells in this child Chapter When Jesus was six years old his mother sent him to draw water to carry into the house But he accidentally let the water go in the crowd and crashing the water jar broke But unfolding the cloak which was thrown around him he filled it with water and carried it to his mother When his mother saw the sign he had done she kissed him and treasured in her heart the mysterious things she had seen him do Chapter Then again in the season of sowing the child went with his father to sow grain in their field And as his father was sowing the child Jesus also sowed one measure of grain And after he harvested and threshed it it produced one hundred measures And calling all the poor of the village to the threshing floor he gave them grain freely And Joseph carried the remaining grain away Jesus was eight years old when he did this sign Chapter Since his father was a carpenter he was making plows and yokes in that season An order for a bed was given to him from a rich man but one of the boards the one called the crossbeam was shorter than the other And since Joseph had no idea what to do the child Jesus said to his father Joseph Put the two pieces of wood down and line up the ends And Joseph did just as the child told him Then Jesus stood at the other end and grasped the shorter piece of wood and stretching it he made it equal with the other And his father Joseph saw and was amazed and taking the child he kissed him saying I am blessed because God gave me this child Chapter When Joseph saw the child s willingness and age and that his mind was also ready he again wanted him to become accustomed to letters So taking him he gave him to another teacher The teacher said to Joseph First I will teach him Greek then Hebrew For the teacher knew about the child s earlier attempt and was afraid Nonetheless after writing the alphabet he instructed the boy for many hours even though he did not reply to him Then Jesus said to him If you are really a teacher and if you know the letters so well tell me the meaning of the alpha and I will tell you the meaning of the beta As he was growing frustrated the teacher struck him on the head Then Jesus became angry and cursed him Immediately he fainted and fell on his face Then Jesus turned back to Joseph s house but Joseph was distressed He instructed the boy s mother Do not let him out the door because the people who anger him will die Chapter After some time had passed again another teacher a close friend of Joseph said to him Send the child to me in my classroom Perhaps with flattery I will be able to teach him the letters And Joseph said to him If you are sure brother take him with you And while he took him along with much fear and anxiety the child went along gladly And coming boldly into the classroom he found a book lying on the desk and taking it he read the letters in it Opening his mouth he spoke in the Holy Spirit and taught the law to those standing there A large multitude came and stood around listening to him And they marveled at the fullness of his teaching and the readiness of his speech saying This is a child saying such things When Joseph heard what was going on he was afraid and ran to the classroom thinking This teacher is not accustomed to him The teacher however said to Joseph Brother I want you to know that I received the child as a student but since he is full of grace and wisdom I am asking you brother take him to your house When the child heard these things he immediately smiled at him and said Since you have spoken and witnessed correctly for your sake the one who was wounded will be healed And at once the other teacher was healed Then Joseph took the child and went back to his house Chapter Then Joseph sent his son James to tie up wood and bring it into his house but the child Jesus also followed him And while James was collecting the bushes a viper bit his hand And as he lay on the ground dying Jesus approached and blew on the bite And immediately his anguish ceased and the animal broke apart and at once James was healthy Chapter After these things happened an infant in Joseph s neighborhood died and his mother mourned greatly When Jesus heard that she was extremely sad and was making an uproar he ran there frantically And finding the child dead he touched his stomach and said I say to you infant do not die but live and be with your mother Immediately he was resurrected and laughed Then Jesus said to the woman Take the child give him your breast and remember me And when the crowd standing around saw this they were amazed and said Truly this child either was God or an angel of God because all his words are completed deeds And Jesus departed from there playing with other children Chapter Another year later a man building a house died after falling from the full height of it And after a great commotion began Jesus stood up and went there And seeing the dead man lying there he grabbed his hand and said I say to you man arise do your work And rising up immediately he worshipped him When the crowd saw they were amazed and said This child is a heavenly being For he has saved many souls from death and has the power to continue saving souls throughout his whole life Chapter When he was twelve years old his parents went to Jerusalem with a caravan for the festival of Passover as was their custom And after the Passover they returned to their home When they departed however the child Jesus returned to Jerusalem although his parents thought he was in the caravan After traveling along the road for one day they sought him among their relatives When they did not find him they grieved And they turned back to the city searching for him And after three days they found him in the temple sitting in the middle of the teachers and listening to the law and questioning them Everyone paid attention to him and was amazed at how this child was questioning the elders and teachers of the people so closely interpreting the chief points of the law and parables of the prophets Then his mother Mary came to him and said Why did you do this to us child See how we are troubled as we search for you And Jesus said to them Why are you searching for me Do you not know that I must be in my father s house Then the scribes and Pharisees said Are you the mother of this child She said I am And they said to her Blessed are you among women because God has blessed the fruit of your womb For we have never seen or heard such glory or virtue or wisdom When Jesus got up he followed his mother and submitted to his parents And his mother treasured everything that had happened And Jesus continued to grow in wisdom and age and grace To him be the glory forever and ever amen ",

"LETTER_TIBERIUS Since you have given a violent and iniquitous sentence of death against Jesus of Nazareth showing no pity and having received gifts to condemn him and with your tongue have expressed sympathy but in your heart have delivered him up you shall be brought home a prisoner to answer for yourself I have been exceedingly distressed at the reports that have reached me a woman a disciple of Jesus has been here called Mary Magdalene out of whom he is said to have cast seven devils and has told of all his wonderful cures How could you permit him to be crucified If you did not receive him as a God you might at least have honoured him as a physician Your own deceitful writing to me has condemned you As you unjustly sentenced him I shall justly sentence you and your accomplices as well Pilate Archelaus Philip Annas and Caiaphas were arrested Rachaab and the soldiers slew all the Jewish males defiled the women and brought the leaders to Rome On the way Caiaphas died in Crete the earth would not receive his body and he was covered with a cairn of stones It was the old law that if a condemned criminal saw the face of the emperor he was spared so Tiberius would not see Pilate but shut him up in a cave Annas was sewed into a fresh bull s hide which contracting as it dried squeezed him to death The other chiefs of the Jews were beheaded Archelaus and Philip were crucified One day the emperor went out to hunt and chased a hind to the door of Pilate s prison Pilate looked out trying to see the emperor s face but at that moment the emperor shot an arrow at the hind which went in at the window and killed Pilate The same tale is told in a Greek life of Mary Magdalene which I have transcribed from a manuscript at Holkham and which is evidently under strong Western influence since it tells the story of her mission to Marseilles and of a miracle wrought on a prince there which is a very favourite subject with French mediaeval artists THE DEATH OF PILATE The Emperor Tiberius being sorely diseased heard that there was a wonderful physician in Jerusalem named Jesus who healed all sicknesses He sent an officer of his named Volusianus to Pilate to bid him send the physician to him Pilate was terrified knowing that Jesus had been crucified On the way back to his inn Volusianus met a matron called Veronica and asked her about Jesus She told him the truth to his great grief and to console him added that when our Lord was away teaching she had desired to have a picture of him always by her and went to carry a linen cloth to a painter for that purpose Jesus met her and on hearing what she wished took the cloth from her and imprinted the features of his face upon it This cloth she said will cure your lord I cannot sell it but I will go with you to him Volusianus and Veronica returned to Rome and Tiberius when the likeness was to be brought to him spread the path with silken cloths He was instantly healed by looking at the likeness Pilate was arrested and brought before the emperor at Rome Now he was wearing the seamless tunic of Jesus When he came before the emperor he who had been raging against him before became quite mild He sent Pilate away and immediately his rage returned This happened again Then either by divine inspiration or on the suggestion of some Christian he had him stripped of the tunic sent him back to prison and shortly after sentenced him to die by the basest of deaths On hearing this Pilate killed himself with his own knife Caesar had a millstone tied to his neck and threw him into the Tiber The demons gathered in crowds and storms disturbed the place so that all were in great fear The corpse was taken out of the river and carried off to Vienne on the Rhone with the same result Thence it was taken to be buried in the territory of Lausanne but disturbances continued there till the inhabitants dug it up and threw it into a well surrounded by mountains where diabolical manifestations are still said to occur The last class of these legends is somewhat older We have it in several forms in Latin and also in an old Anglo Saxon version It has something in common with the Death of Pilate and it merges into the romances of the Destruction of Jerusalem which were very popular in the thirteenth and fourteenth centuries The oldest form is that called the Healing of Tiberius which goes back in manuscripts to the eighth century This runs as follows Tiberius was sorely diseased He heard from a Jew named Thomas of the miracles of Jesus and sent a great officer Volusianus to bring him from Jerusalem The voyage took a year and three months Pilate and the Jews were much frightened Pilate had to be persuaded by one of his soldiers that it was the crucified Jesus who was meant the evidence for the resurrection was confirmed by Joseph of Arimathaea and others Pilate imprisoned meanwhile was made to avow his guilt publicly A young man named Marcius now informed Volusian that a woman of Tyre Veronica possessed the likeness of Jesus who had cured her issue of blood three years before Denying it at first she at last produced it under compulsion Volusian adored it and threatened with punishment all who had taken part in Jesus death He then set off for Rome with Veronica and Pilate and reached it in a short time Tiberius inquired why Pilate had not been executed Volusian said he did not wish to anticipate the emperor s judgement Tiberius banished Pilate without seeing him to Ameria in Tuscany Volusian then brought Veronica and the likeness to Tiberius who adored it and was healed He gave money to Veronica and made a precious shrine for the likeness was baptized and died after some years in peace The next development of the legend is thought to originate in Aquitaine The manuscripts go back to the tenth century and the Anglo Saxon version is not later than the eleventh The name of this is ",

"APOCALYPSE_OF_THE_VIRGIN The Virgin at the Mount of Olives prays to be told about the torments of hell and the next world Michael is sent He takes her to the west the earth opens and discloses the lost who did not worship the Trinity She sees a great darkness At her prayer it is lifted and she sees souls tormented with boiling pitch No one has yet interceded for them neither Abraham John Baptist Moses nor Paul They are unbelievers They go to the south there is a river of fire with souls immersed at various depths Cursers of their parents Causers of abortion False swearers A man hung by the feet and devoured by worms is a usurer A woman hung by the ears with serpents coming out of her mouth and biting her is a backbiter and gossip They go to the west In a cloud of fire lie those who lay late on Sunday On fiery seats sit those who did not rise at the entry of the priest On an iron tree hang blasphemers and slanderers A man hung by hands and feet is the evil steward of a church Wicked priests readers bishops widows of priests who married again an archdeaconess covetous women are severally described They go to the left hand of paradise In a river of pitch and fire are the Jews who crucified Jesus those who denied baptism those guilty of various impurities sorcerers murderers they who strangle their children In a lake of fire are bad Christians A great appeal of the Virgin follows in which she entreats all the saints to intercede with her for the Christians At last the Son appears and grants the days of Pentecost as a season of rest to the lost In some texts a visit of the Virgin to paradise follows this but it is usually short and uninteresting In one of the Eastern books on the Assumption there is a very diffuse account of paradise as seen by the Virgin Women are seen bitten by serpents dogs lions and leopards of fire They are nuns who violated the rule and slew their children Often they caused their death before they were born They shed their blood on the ground or killed them when born or their fathers gave poison to the mothers But these children cry out before the throne of my Father and say Lord they have not suffered us to grow up to do good or evil the half of us they gave to the dogs and cast the other half to the swine And when we heard the words of these children I and my Father and the Comforter were grieved and I commanded Temliaqos to set them in a beautiful abode But for their fathers and mothers this is their torment for ever The Virgin says If they repent wilt thou not forgive them Yes if they do so from their heart But as for their pastors who did not admonish them their part shall be with Eli and Fola Eli did not reprove his sons Fola sold his daughters for an ox ",

"ORACLES SECOND BOOK OF THE SIBYLLINE ORACLES Woe unto all them that are found great with child in that day and to them that give suck to infant children and to them that dwell by the sea Woe to them that shall behold that day For a dark mist shall cover the boundless world of the east and west the south and north And then shall a great river of flaming fire flow from heaven and consume all places the earth and the great ocean and the grey sea lakes and rivers and fountains and merciless Hades and the pole of heaven but the lights of heaven shall melt together in one and into a void shape For the stars shall all fall from heaven into the sea and all souls of men shall gnash their teeth as they burn in the river of brimstone and the rush of the fire in the blazing plain and ashes shall cover all things And then shall all the elements of the world be laid waste air earth sea light poles days and nights and no more shall the multitudes of birds fly in the air nor swimming creatures any more swim the sea no ship shall sail with its cargo over the waves no straight going oxen shall plough the tilled land there shall be no more sound of swift winds but he shall fuse all things together into one and purge them clean Now when the immortal angels of the undying God Barakiel Ramiel Uriel Samiel and Azael knowing all the evil deeds that any hath wrought aforetime—then out of the misty darkness they shall bring all the souls of men to judgement unto the seat of God the immortal the great Yor he only is incorruptible himself the Almighty who shall be the judge of mortal men And then unto them of the underworld shall the heavenly one give their souls and spirit and speech and their bones joined together with all the joints and the flesh and sinews and veins and skin also over the flesh and hair as before and the bodies of the dwellers upon earth shall be moved and arise in one day joined together in immortal fashion and breathing Then shall the great angel Uriel break the monstrous bars framed of unyielding and unbroken adamant of the brazen gates of Hades and cast them down straightway and bring forth to judgement all the sorrowful forms yea of the ghosts of the ancient Titans and of the giants and all whom the flood overtook And all whom the wave of the sea hath destroyed in the waters and all whom beasts and creeping things and fowls have feasted on all these shall he bring to the judgement seat and again those whom flesh devouring fire hath consumed in the flames them also shall he gather and set before God’s seat And when he shall overcome Fate and raise the dead then shall Adonai Sabaoth the high thunderer sit on his heavenly throne and set up the great pillar and Christ himself the undying unto the undying shall come in the clouds in glory with the pure angels and shall sit on the seat on the right of the Great One judging the life of the godly and the walk of ungodly men And Moses also the great the friend of the Most High shall come clad in flesh and the great Abraham himself shall come and Isaac and Jacob Jesus Daniel Elias Ambacum and Jonas and they whom the Hebrews slew and all the Hebrews that were with Jeremias shall be judged at the judgement seat and he shall destroy them that they may receive a due reward and expiate all that they did in their mortal life And then shall all men pass through a blazing river and unquenchable flame and the righteous shall be saved whole all of them but the ungodly shall perish therein unto all ages even as many as wrought evil aforetime and committed murders and all that were privy thereto liars thieves deceivers cruel destroyers of houses gluttons marriers by stealth shedders of evil rumours sorely insolent lawless idolaters and all that forsook the great immortal God and became blasphemers and harmers of the godly breakers of faith and destroyers of righteous men And all that look with guileful and shameless double faces—reverend priests and deacons—tand judge unjustly dealing perversely obeying false rumours more deadly than leopards and wolves and very evil and all that are high minded and usurers that heap up in their houses usury out of usury and injure orphans and widows continually and they that give alms of unjust gain unto widows and orphans and they that when they give alms of their own toil reproach them and they that have forsaken their parents in their old age and not repaid them at all nor recompensed them for their nurture yea and they that have disobeyed and spoken hard words against their parents they also that have received pledges and denied them and servants that have turned against their masters and again they which have defiled their flesh in lasciviousness and have loosed the girdle of virginity in secret union and they that make the child in the womb miscarry and that cast out their offspring against right sorcerers also and sorceresses with these shall the wrath of the heavenly and immortal God bring near unto the pillar all round about which the untiring river of fire shall flow And all of them shall the undying angels of the immortal everlasting God chastise terribly with flaming scourges and shall bind them fast from above in fiery chains bonds unbreakable And then shall they cast them down in the darkness of night into Gehenna among the beasts of hell many and frightful where is darkness without measure And when they have dealt out many torments unto all whose heart was evil thereafter out of the great river shall a wheel of fire encompass them because they devised wicked works And then shall they lament apart every one from another in miserable fate fathers and infant children mothers and sucklings weeping nor shall they be sated with tears nor shall the voice of them that mourn piteously apart be heard but far under dark and squalid Tartarus shall they cry in torment and in no holy place shall they abide and expiate threefold every evil deed that they have done burning in a great flame and shall gnash their teeth all of them worn out with fierce thirst and hunger and shall call death lovely and it shall flee from them for no more shall death nor night give them rest and oft times shall they beseech in vain the Almighty God and then shall he openly turn away his face from them For he hath granted the limit of seven ages for repentance unto men that err by the hand of a pure virgin But the residue which have cared for justice and good deeds yea and godliness and righteous thoughts shall angels bear up and carry through the flaming river unto light and life without care where is the immortal path of the great God and three fountains of wine and honey and milk And the earth common to all not parted out with walls or fences shall then bring forth of her own accord much fruit and life and wealth shall be common and undistributed For there shall be no poor man nor rich nor tyrant nor slave none great nor small any longer no kings no princes but all men shall be together in common And no more shall any man say night is come nor the morrow nor it was yesterday He maketh no more of days nor of spring nor winter nor summer nor autumn neither marriage nor death nor selling nor buying nor set of sun nor rising For God shall make one long day And unto them the godly shall the almighty and immortal God grant another boon when they shall ask it of him He shall grant them to save men out of the fierce fire and the eternal gnashing of teeth and this will he do for he will gather them again out of the everlasting flame and remove them elsewhither sending them for the sake of his people unto another life eternal and immortal in the Elysian plain where are the long waves of the Acherusian lake exhaustless and deep bosomed ",

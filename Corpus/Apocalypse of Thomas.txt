"APOCALYPSE_OF_THOMAS Here beginneth the epistle of the Lord unto Thomas Hear thou Thomas the things which must come to pass in the last times there shall be famine and war and earthquakes in divers places snow and ice and great drought shall there be and many dissensions among the peoples blasphemy iniquity envy and villainy indolence pride and intemperance so that every man shall speak that which pleaseth him And my priests shall not have peace among themselves but shall sacrifice unto me with deceitful mind therefore will I not look upon them Then shall the priests behold the people departing from the house of the Lord and turning unto the world and setting up landmarks in the house of God And they shall claim for themselves many places that were lost and that shall be subject unto Caesar as also they were aforetime giving poll taxes of the cities even gold and silver and the chief men of the cities shall be condemned and their substance brought into† the treasury of the kings and they shall be filled For there shall be great disturbance throughout all the people and death The house of the Lord shall be desolate and their altars shall be abhorred so that spiders weave their webs therein The place of holiness shall be corrupted the priesthood polluted distress shall increase virtue shall be overcome joy perish and gladness depart In those days evil shall abound there shall be respecters of persons hymns shall cease out of the house of the Lord truth shall be no more covetousness shall abound among the priests an upright man shall not be found On a sudden there shall arise near the last time a king a lover of the law who shall hold rule not for long he shall leave two sons The first is named of the first letter the second of the eighth The first shall die before the second Thereafter shall arise two princes to oppress the nations under whose hands there shall be a very great famine in the right hand part of the east so that nation shall rise up against nation and be driven out from their own borders Again another king shall arise a crafty man and shall command a golden image of Caesar to be made wherefore martyrdoms shall abound Then shall faith return unto the servants of the Lord and holiness shall be multiplied and distress increase The mountains shall †be comforted† and shall drop down sweetness †of fire from the face† that the number of the saints may be accomplished After a little space there shall arise a king out of the east a lover of the law who shall cause all good things and necessary to abound in the house of the Lord he shall show mercy unto the widows and to the needy and command a royal gift to be given unto the priests in his days shall be abundance of all things And after that again a king shall arise in the south part of the world and shall hold rule a little space in whose days the treasury shall fail because of the wages of the Roman soldiers †so that the substance of all the aged shall be commanded and given to the king to distribute† Thereafter shall be plenty of corn and wine and oil but great dearness of money so that the substance of gold and silver shall be given for corn and there shall be great dearth At that time shall be very great rising of the sea so that no man shall tell news to any man The kings of the earth and the princes and the captains shall be troubled and no man shall speak freely Grey hairs shall be seen upon boys and the young shall not give place unto the aged After that shall arise another king a crafty man who shall hold rule for a short space in whose days there shall be all manner of evils even the death of the race of men from the east even unto Babylon And thereafter death and famine and sword in the land of Chanaan even unto Then shall all the fountains of waters and wells boil over and be turned into blood The heaven shall be moved the stars shall fall upon the earth the sun shall be cut in half like the moon and the moon shall not give her light There shall be great signs and wonders in those days when Antichrist draweth near These are the signs unto them that dwell in the earth In those days the pains of great travail shall come upon them Woe unto them that build for they shall not inhabit Woe unto them that break up the fallow for they shall labour without cause Woe unto them that make marriages for unto famine and need shall they beget sons Woe unto them that join house to house or field to field for all things shall be consumed with fire Woe unto them that look not unto themselves while time alloweth for hereafter shall they be condemned for ever Woe unto them that turn away from the poor when he asketh These are the seven signs before the ending of this world There shall be in all the earth famine and great pestilences and much distress then shall all men be led captive among all nations and shall fall by the edge of the sword On the first day of the judgement will be a great marvel At the third hour of the day shall be a great and mighty voice in the firmament of the heaven and a great cloud of blood coming down out of the north and great thunderings and mighty lightnings shall follow that cloud and there shall be a rain of blood upon all the earth These are the signs of the first day And on the second day there shall be a great voice in the firmament of the heaven and the earth shall be moved out of its place and the gates of heaven shall be opened in the firmament of heaven toward the east and a great power shall be sent forth by the gates of heaven and shall cover all the heaven even until evening These are the signs of the second day And on the third day about the second hour shall be a voice in heaven and the abysses of the earth shall utter their voice from the four corners of the world The first heaven shall be rolled up like a book and shall straightway vanish And because of the smoke and stench of the brimstone of the abyss the days shall be darkened unto the tenth hour Then shall all men say I think that the end draweth near that we shall perish These are the signs of the third day And on the fourth day at the first hour the earth of the east shall speak the abyss shall roar then shall all the earth be moved by the strength of an earthquake In that day shall all the idols of the heathen fall and all the buildings of the earth These are the signs of the fourth day And on the fifth day at the sixth hour there shall be great thunderings suddenly in the heaven and the powers of light and the wheel of the sun shall be caught away and there shall be great darkness over the world until evening and the stars shall be turned away from their ministry In that day all nations shall hate the world and despise the life of this world These are the signs of the fifth day And on the sixth day there shall be signs in heaven At the fourth hour the firmament of heaven shall be cloven from the east unto the west And the angels of the heavens shall be looking forth upon the earth through the opening of the heavens And all men shall see above the earth the host of the angels looking forth out of heaven Then shall all men flee ",

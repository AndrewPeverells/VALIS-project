"ACTS_OF_ANDREW After the Ascension the apostles dispersed to preach in various countries Andrew began in the province of Achaia but Matthew went to the city of Mermidona Andrew left Mermidona and came back to his own allotted district Walking with his disciples he met a blind man who said Andrew apostle of Christ I know you can restore my sight but I do not wish for that only bid those with you to give me enough money to clothe and feed myself decently Andrew said This is the devil s voice who will not allow the man to recover his sight He touched his eyes and healed him Then as be had but a vile rough garment Andrew said Take the filthy garment off him and clothe him afresh All were ready to strip themselves and Andrew said Let him have what will suffice him He returned home thankful Demetrius of Amasea had an Egyptian boy of whom he was very fond who died of a fever Demetrius hearing of Andrew s miracles came fell at his feet and besought help Andrew pitied him came to the house held a very long discourse turned to the bier raised the boy and restored him to his master All believed and were baptized A Christian lad named Sostratus came to Andrew privately and told him My mother cherishes a guilty passion for me I have repulsed her and she has gone to the proconsul to throw the guilt on me I would rather die than expose her The officers came to fetch the boy and Andrew prayed and went with him The mother accused him The proconsul bade him defend himself He was silent and so continued until the proconsul retired to take counsel The mother began to weep Andrew said Unhappy woman that dost not fear to cast thine own guilt on thy son She said to the proconsul Ever since my son entertained his wicked wish he has been in constant company with this man The proconsul was enraged ordered the lad to be sewn into the leather bag of parricides and drowned in the river and Andrew to be imprisoned till his punishment should be devised Andrew prayed there was an earthquake the proconsul fell from his seat every one was prostrated and the mother withered up and died The proconsul fell at Andrew s feet praying for mercy The earthquake and thunder ceased and he healed those who had been hurt The proconsul and his house were baptized The son of Cratinus of Sinope bathed in the women s bath and was seized by a demon Cratinus wrote to Andrew for help he himself had a fever and his wife dropsy Andrew went there in a vehicle The boy tormented by the evil spirit fell at his feet He bade it depart and so it did with outcries He then went to Cratinus bed and told him he well deserved to suffer because of his loose life and bade him rise and sin no more He was healed The wife was rebuked for her infidelity If she is to return to her former sin let her not now be healed if she can keep from it let her be healed The water broke out of her body and she was cured The apostle brake bread and gave it her She thanked God believed with all her house and relapsed no more into sin Cratinus afterwards sent Andrew great gifts by his servants and then with his wife asked him in person to accept them but he refused saying It is rather for you to give them to the needy After this he went to Nicaea where were seven devils living among the tombs by the wayside who at noon stoned passersby and had killed many And all the city came out to meet Andrew with olive branches crying Our salvation is in thee O man of God When they had told him all he said If you believe in Christ you shall be freed They cried We will He thanked God and commanded the demons to appear they came in the form of dogs Said he These are your enemies if you profess your belief that I can drive them out in Jesus name I will do so They cried out We believe that Jesus Christ whom thou preachest is the Son of God Then he bade the demons go into dry and barren places and hurt no man till the last day They roared and vanished The apostle baptized the people and made Callistus bishop At the gate of Nicomedia he met a dead man borne on a bier and his old father supported by slaves hardly able to walk and his old mother with hair torn bewailing How has it happened he asked He was alone in his chamber and seven dogs rushed on him and killed him Andrew sighed and said This is an ambush of the demons I banished from Nicaea What will you do father if I restore your son I have nothing more precious than him I will give him He prayed Let the spirit of this lad return The faithful responded Amen Andrew bade the lad rise and he rose and all cried Great is the God of Andrew The parents offered great gifts which he refused but took the lad to Macedonia instructing him Embarking in a ship he sailed into the Hellespont on the way to Byzantium There was a great storm Andrew prayed and there was calm They reached Byzantium Thence proceeding through Thrace they met a troop of armed men who made as if to fall on them Andrew made the sign of the cross against them and prayed that they might be made powerless A bright angel touched their swords and they all fell down and Andrew and his company passed by while they worshipped him And the angel departed in a great light At Perinthus he found a ship going to Macedonia and an angel told him to go on board As he preached the captain and the rest heard and were converted and Andrew glorified God for making himself known on the sea At Philippi were two brothers one of whom had two sons the other two daughters They were rich and noble and said There is no family as good as ours in the place let us marry our sons to our daughters It was agreed and the earnest paid by the father of the sons On the wedding day a word from God came to them Wait till my servant Andrew comes he will tell you what you should do All preparations had been made and guests bidden but they waited On the third day Andrew came they went out to meet him with wreaths and told him how they had been charged to wait for him and how things stood His face was shining so that they marvelled at him He said Do not my children be deceived rather repent for you have sinned in thinking to join together those who are near of kin We do not forbid or shun marriage this cannot be the author s original sentiment it is contradicted by all that we know of the Acts It is a divine institution but we condemn incestuous unions The parents were troubled and prayed for pardon The young people saw Andrew s face like that of an angel and said We are sure that your teaching is true The apostle blessed them and departed At Thessalonica was a rich noble youth Exoos who came without his parents knowledge and asked to be shown the way of truth He was taught and believed and followed Andrew taking no care of his worldly estate The parents heard that he was at Philippi and tried to bribe him with gifts to leave Andrew He said Would that you had not these riches then would you know the true God and escape his wrath Andrew too came down from the third storey and preached to them but in vain he retired and shut the doors of the house They gathered a band and came to burn the house saying Death to the son who has forsaken his parents and brought torches reeds and faggots and set the house on fire It blazed up Exoos took a bottle of water and prayed Lord Jesu Christ in whose hand is the nature of all the elements who moistenest the dry and driest the moist coolest the hot and kindlest the quenched put out this fire that thy servants may not grow evil but be more enkindled unto faith He sprinkled the flames and they died He is become a sorcerer said the parents and got ladders to climb up and kill them but God blinded them They remained obstinate but one Lysimachus a citizen said Why persevere God is fighting for these Desist lest heavenly fire consume you They were touched and said This is the true God It was now night but a light shone out and they received sight They went up and fell before Andrew and asked pardon and their repentance made Lysimachus say Truly Christ whom Andrew preaches is the Son of God All were converted except the youth s parents who cursed him and went home again leaving all their money to public uses Fifty days after they suddenly died and the citizens who loved the youth returned the property to him He did not leave Andrew but spent his income on the poor The youth asked Andrew to go with him to Thessalonica All assembled in the theatre glad to see their favourite The youth preached to them Andrew remaining silent and all wondered at his wisdom The people cried out Save the son of Carpianus who is ill and we will believe Carpianus went to his house and said to the boy You shall be cured to day Adimantus He said Then my dream is come true I saw this man in a vision healing me He rose up dressed and ran to the theatre outstripping his father and fell at Andrew s feet The people seeing him walk after twenty three years cried There is none like the God of Andrew A citizen had a son possessed by an unclean spirit and asked for his cure The demon foreseeing that he would be cast out took the son aside into a chamber and made him hang himself The father said Bring him to the theatre I believe this stranger is able to raise him He said the same to Andrew Andrew said to the people What will it profit you if you see this accomplished and do not believe They said Fear not we will believe The lad was raised and they said It is enough we do believe And they escorted Andrew to the house with torches and lamps for it was night and he taught them for three days Medias of Philippi came and prayed for his sick son Andrew wiped his cheeks and stroked his head saying Be comforted only believe and went with him to Philippi As they entered the city an old man met them and entreated for his sons whom for an unspeakable crime Medias had imprisoned and they were putrefied with sores Andrew said How can you ask help for your son when you keep these men bound Loose their chains first for your unkindness obstructs my prayers Medias penitent said I will loose these two and seven others of whom you have not been told They were brought tended for three days cured and freed Then the apostle healed the son Philomedes who had been ill twenty two years The people cried Heal our sick as well Andrew told Philomedes to visit them in their houses and bid them rise in the name of Jesus Christ by which he had himself been healed This was done and all believed and offered gifts which Andrew did not accept A citizen Nicolaus offered a gilt chariot and four white mules and four white horses as his most precious possession for the cure of his daughter Andrew smiled I accept your gifts but not these visible ones if you offer this for your daughter what will you for your soul That is what I desire of you that the inner man may recognize the true God reject earthly things and desire eternal He persuaded all to forsake their idols and healed the girl His fame went through all Macedonia Next day as he taught a youth cried out What hast thou to do with us Art thou come to turn us out of our own place Andrew summoned him What is your work I have dwelt in this boy from his youth and thought never to leave him but three days since I heard his father say I shall go to Andrew and now I fear the torments thou bringest us and I shall depart The spirit left the boy And many came and asked In whose name dost thou cure our sick Philosophers also came and disputed with him and no one could resist his teaching At this time one who opposed him went to the proconsul Virinus and said A man is arisen in Thessalonica who says the temples should be destroyed and ceremonies done away and all the ancient law abolished and one God worshipped whose servant he says he is The proconsul sent soldiers and knights to fetch Andrew They found his dwelling when they entered his face so shone that they fell down in fear Andrew told those present the proconsul s purpose The people armed themselves against the soldiers but Andrew stopped them The proconsul arrived not finding Andrew in the appointed place he raged like a lion and sent twenty more men They on arrival were confounded and said nothing The proconsul sent a large troop to bring him by force Andrew said Have you come for me Yes if you are the sorcerer who says the gods ought not to be worshipped I am no sorcerer but the apostle of Jesus Christ whom I preach At this one of the soldiers drew his sword and cried What have I to do with thee Virinus that thou sendest me to one who can not only cast me out of this vessel but burn me by his power Would that you would come yourself you would do him no harm And the devil went out of the soldier and he fell dead On this came the proconsul and stood before Andrew but could not see him I am he whom thou seekest His eyes were opened and he said in anger What is this madness that thou despisest us and our officers Thou art certainly a sorcerer Now will I throw thee to the beasts for contempt of our gods and us and we shall see if the crucified whom thou preachest will help thee Andrew Thou must believe proconsul in the true God and his Son whom he hath sent specially now that one of thy men is dead And after long prayer he touched the soldier Rise up my God Jesus Christ raiseth thee He arose and stood whole The people cried Glory be to our God The proconsul Believe not O people believe not the sorcerer They said This is no sorcery but sound and true teaching The proconsul I shall throw this man to the beasts and write about you to Caesar that ye may perish for contemning his laws They would have stoned him and said Write to Caesar that the Macedonians have received the word of God and forsaking their idols worship the true God Then the proconsul in wrath retired to the praetorium and in the morning brought beasts to the stadium and had the Apostle dragged thither by the hair and beaten with clubs First they sent in a fierce boar who went about him thrice and touched him not The people praised God A bull led by thirty soldiers and incited by two hunters did not touch Andrew but tore the hunters to pieces roared and fell dead Christ is the true God said the people An angel was seen to descend and strengthen the apostle The proconsul in rage sent in a fierce leopard which left every one alone but seized and strangled the proconsul s son but Virinus was so angry that he said nothing of it nor cared Andrew said to the people Recognize now that this is the true God whose power subdues the beasts though Virinus knows him not But that ye may believe the more I will raise the dead son and confound the foolish father After long prayer he raised him The people would have slain Virinus but Andrew restrained them and Virinus went to the praetorium confounded After this a youth who followed the apostle sent for his mother to meet Andrew She came and after being instructed begged him to come to their house which was devastated by a great serpent As Andrew approached it hissed loudly and with raised head came to meet him it was fifty cubits long every one fell down in fear Andrew said Hide thy head foul one which thou didst raise in the beginning for the hurt of mankind and obey the servants of God and die The serpent roared and coiled about a great oak near by and vomited poison and blood and died Andrew went to the woman s farm where a child killed by the serpent lay dead He said to the parents Our God who would have you saved hath sent me here that you may believe on him Go and see the slayer slain They said We care not so much for the child s death if we be avenged They went and Andrew said to the proconsul s wife Go and raise the boy She went nothing doubting and said In the name of my God Jesus Christ rise up whole The parents returned and found their child alive and fell at Andrew s feet On the next night he saw a vision which he related Hearken beloved to my vision I beheld and lo a great mountain raised up on high which had on it nothing earthly but only shone with such light that it seemed to enlighten all the world And lo there stood by me my beloved brethren the apostles Peter and John and John reached his hand to Peter and raised him to the top of the mount and turned to me and asked me to go up after Peter saying Andrew thou art to drink Peter s cup And he stretched out his hands and said Draw near to me and stretch out thy hands so as to join them unto mine and put thy head by my head When I did so I found myself shorter than John After that he said to me Wouldst thou know the image of that which thou seest and who it is that speaketh to thee and I said I desire to know it And he said to me I am the word of the cross whereon thou shalt hang shortly for his name s sake whom thou preachest And many other things said he unto me of which I must now say nothing but they shall be declared when I come unto the sacrifice But now let all assemble that have received the word of God and let me commend them unto the Lord Jesus Christ that he may vouchsafe to keep them unblemished in his teaching For I am now being loosed from the body and go unto that promise which he hath vouchsafed to promise me who is the Lord of heaven and earth the Son of God Almighty very God with the Holy Ghost continuing for everlasting ages All the brethren wept and smote their faces When all were gathered Andrew said Know beloved that I am about to leave you but I trust in Jesus whose word I preach that he will keep you from evil that this harvest which I have sown among you may not be plucked up by the enemy that is the knowledge and teaching of my Lord Jesus Christ But do ye pray always and stand firm in the faith that the Lord may root out all tares of offence and vouchsafe to gather you into his heavenly garner as pure wheat So for five days he taught and confirmed them then he spread his hands and prayed Keep I beseech thee O Lord this flock which hath now known thy salvation that the wicked one may not prevail against it but that what by thy command and my means it hath received it may be able to preserve inviolate for ever And all responded Amen He took bread brake it with thanksgiving gave it to all saying Receive the grace which Christ our Lord God giveth you by me his servant He kissed every one and commended them to the Lord and departed to Thessalonica and after teaching there two days he left them Many faithful from Macedonia accompanied him in two ships And all were desirous of being on Andrew s ship to hear him He said I know your wish but this ship is too small Let the servants and baggage go in the larger ship and you with me in this He gave them Anthimus to comfort them and bade them go into another ship which he ordered to keep always near that they might see him and hear the word of God And as he slept a little one fell overboard Anthimus roused him saying Help us good master one of thy servants perisheth He rebuked the wind there was a calm and the man was borne by the waves to the ship Anthimus helped him on board and all marvelled On the twelfth day they reached Patrae in Achaia disembarked and went to an inn Many asked him to lodge with them but he said he could only go where God bade him That night he had no revelation and the next night being distressed at this he heard a voice saying Andrew I am alway with thee and forsake thee not and was glad Lesbius the proconsul was told in a vision to take him in and sent a messenger for him He came and entering the proconsul s chamber found him lying as dead with closed eyes he struck him on the side and said Rise and tell us what hath befallen thee Lesbius said I abominated the way which you teach and sent soldiers in ships to the proconsul of Macedonia to send you bound to me but they were wrecked and could not reach their destination As I continued in my purpose of destroying your Way two black men appeared and scourged me saying We can no longer prevail here for the man is coming whom you mean to persecute So to night while we still have the power we will avenge ourselves on you And they beat me sorely and left me But now do you pray that I may be pardoned and healed Andrew preached the word and all believed and the proconsul was healed and confirmed in the faith Now Trophima once the proconsul s mistress and now married to another left her husband and clave to Andrew Her husband came to her lady and said she was renewing her liaison with the proconsul The wife enraged said This is why my husband has left me these six months She called her steward and had Trophima sentenced as a prostitute and sent to the brothel Lesbius knew nothing and was deceived by his wife when he asked about her Trophima in the brothel prayed continually and had the Gospel on her bosom and no one could approach her One day one offered her violence and the Gospel fell to the ground She cried to God for help and an angel came and the youth fell dead After that she raised him and all the city ran to the sight Lesbius wife went to the bath with the steward and as they bathed an ugly demon came and killed them both Andrew heard and said It is the judgement of God for their usage of Trophima The lady s nurse decrepit from age was carried to the spot and supplicated for her Andrew said to Lesbius Will you have her raised No after all the ill she has done We ought not to be unmerciful Lesbius went to the praetorium Andrew raised his wife who remained shamefaced he bade her go home and pray First she said reconcile me to Trophima whom I have injured She bears you no malice He called her and they were reconciled Callisto was the wife Lesbius growing in faith came one day to Andrew and confessed all his sins Andrew said I thank God my son that thou fearest the judgement to come Be strong in the Lord in whom thou believest And he took his hand and walked with him on the shore They sat down with others on the sand and he taught A corpse was thrown up by the sea near them We must learn said Andrew what the enemy has done to him So he raised him gave him a garment and bade him tell his story He said I am the son of Sostratus of Macedonia lately come from Italy On returning home I heard of a new teaching and set forth to find out about it On the way here we were wrecked and all drowned And after some thought he realized that Andrew was the man he sought and fell at his feet and said I know that thou art the servant of the true God I beseech thee for my companions that they also may be raised and know him Then Andrew instructed him and thereafter prayed God to show the bodies of the other drowned men thirty nine were washed ashore and all there prayed for them to be raised Philopator the youth said My father sent me here with a great sum Now he is blaspheming God and his teaching Let it not be so Andrew ordered the bodies to be collected and said Whom will you have raised first He said Warus my foster brother So he was first raised and then the other thirty eight Andrew prayed over each and then told the brethren each to take the hand of one and say Jesus Christ the son of the living God raiseth thee Lesbius gave much money to Philopator to replace what he had lost and he abode with Andrew A woman Calliopa married to a murderer had an illegitimate child and suffered in travail She told her sister to call on Diana for help when she did so the devil appeared to her at night and said Why do you trouble me with vain prayers Go to Andrew in Achaia She came and he accompanied her to Corinth Lesbius with him Andrew said to Calliopa You deserve to suffer for your evil life but believe in Christ and you will be relieved but the child will be born dead And so it was Andrew did many signs in Corinth Sostratus the father of Philopator warned in a vision to visit Andrew came first to Achaia and then to Corinth He met Andrew walking with Lesbius recognized him by his vision and fell at his feet Philopator said This is my father who seeks to know what he must do Andrew I know that he is come to learn the truth we thank God who reveals himself to believers Leontius the servant of Sostratus said to him Seest thou sir how this man s face shineth I see my beloved said Sostratus let us never leave him but live with him and hear the words of eternal life Next day they offered Andrew many gifts but he said It is not for me to take aught of you but your own selves Had I desired money Lesbius is richer After some days he bade them prepare him a bath and going there saw an old man with a devil trembling exceedingly As he wondered at him another a youth came out of the bath and fell at his feet saying What have we to do with thee Andrew Hast thou come here to turn us out of our abodes Andrew said to the people Fear not and drove out both the devils Then as he bathed he told them The enemy of mankind lies in wait everywhere in baths and in rivers therefore we ought always to invoke the Lord s name that he may have w power over us They brought their sick to him to be healed and so they did from other cities An old man Nicolaus came with clothes rent and said I am seventy four years old and have always been a libertine Three days ago I heard of your miracles and teaching I thought I would turn over a new leaf and then again that I would not in this doubt I took a Gospel and prayed God to make me forget my old devices A few days after I forgot the Gospel I had about me and went to the brothel The woman said Depart old man depart thou art an angel of God touch me not nor approach me for I see in thee a great mystery Then I remembered the Gospel and am come to you for help and pardon Andrew discoursed long against incontinence and prayed from the sixth to the ninth hour He rose and washed his face and said I will not eat till I know if God will have mercy on this man A second day he fasted but had no revelation until the fifth day when he wept vehemently and said Lord we obtain mercy for the dead and now this man that desireth to know thy greatness wherefore should he not return and thou heal him A voice from heaven said Thou hast prevailed for the old man but like as thou art worn with fasting let him also fast that he may be saved And he called him and preached abstinence On the sixth day he asked the brethren all to pray for Nicolaus and they did Andrew then took food and permitted the rest to eat Nicolaus went home gave away all his goods and lived for six months on dry bread and water Then he died Andrew was not there but in the place where he was he heard a voice Andrew Nicolaus for whom thou didst intercede is become mine And he told the brethren that Nicolaus was dead and prayed that he might rest in peace And while he abode in that place Antiphanes of Megara came and said If there be in thee any kindness according to the command of the Saviour whom thou preachest show it now Asked what his story was he told it Returning from a journey I heard the porter of my house crying out They told me that he and his wife and son were tormented of a devil I went upstairs and found other servants gnashing their teeth running at me and laughing madly I went further up and found they had beaten my wife she lay with her hair over her face unable to recognize me Cure her and I care nothing for the others Andrew said There is no respect of persons with God Let us go there They went from Lacedaemon to Megara and when they entered the house all the devils cried out What dost thou here Andrew Go where thou art permitted this house is ours He healed the wife and all the possessed persons and Antiphanes and his wife became firm adherents He returned to Patrae where Egeas was now proconsul and one Iphidamia who had been converted by a disciple Sosias came and embraced his feet and said My lady Maximilla who is in a fever has sent for you The proconsul is standing by her bed with his sword drawn meaning to kill himself when she expires He went to her and said to Egeas Do thyself no harm but put up thy sword into his place There will be a time when thou wilt draw it on me Egeas did not understand but made way Andrew took Maximilla s hand she broke into a sweat and was well he bade them give her food The proconsul sent him pieces of silver but he would not look at them Going thence he saw a sick man lying in the dirt begging and healed him Elsewhere he saw a blind man with wife and son and said This is indeed the devil s work he has blinded them in soul and body He opened their eyes and they believed One who saw this said I beg thee come to the harbour there is a man the son of a sailor sick fifty years cast out of the house lying on the shore incurable full of ulcers and worms They went to him The sick man said Perhaps you are the disciple of that God who alone can save Andrew said I am he who in the name of my God can restore thee to health and added In the name of Jesus Christ rise and follow me He left his filthy rags and followed the pus and worms flowing from him They went into the sea and the apostle washed him in the name of the Trinity and he was whole and ran naked through the city proclaiming the true God At this time the proconsul s brother Stratocles arrived from Italy One of his slaves Alcman whom he loved was taken by a devil and lay foaming in the court Stratocles hearing of it said Would the sea had swallowed me before I saw this Maximilla and Iphidamia said Be comforted there is here a man of God let us send for him When he came he took the boy s hand and raised him whole Stratocles believed and clave to Andrew Maximilla went daily to the praetorium and sent for Andrew to teach there Egeas was away in Macedonia angry because Maximilla had left him since her conversion As they were all assembled one day he returned to their great terror Andrew prayed that he might not be suffered to enter the place till all had dispersed And Egeas was at once seized with indisposition and in the interval the apostle signed them all and sent them away himself last But Maximilla on the first opportunity came to Andrew and received the word of God and went home At about this point we must place the episodes quoted by Evodius of Uzala see below After this Andrew was taken and imprisoned by Egeans and all came to the prison to be taught After a few days he was scourged and crucified he hung for three days preaching and expired as is fully set forth in his Passion Maximilla embalmed and buried his body From the tomb comes manna like flour and oil the amount shows the barrenness or fertility of the coming season as I have told in my first book of Miracles I have not set out his Passion at length because I find it well done by some one else This much have I presumed to write unworthy unlettered c The author s prayer for himself ends the book May Andrew on whose death day he was born intercede to save him ",

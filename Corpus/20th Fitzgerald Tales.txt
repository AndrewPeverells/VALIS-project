"THE JELLYBEAN Jim Powell was a Jellybean Much as I desire to make him an appealing character I feel that it would be unscrupulous to deceive you on that point He was a bredinthebone dyedinthewool ninetynine threequarters per cent Jellybean and he grew lazily all during Jellybean season which is every season down in the land of the Jellybeans well below the MasonDixon line Now if you call a Memphis man a Jellybean he will quite possibly pull a long sinewy rope from his hip pocket and hang you to a convenient telegraphpole If you Call a New Orleans man a Jellybean he will probably grin and ask you who is taking your girl to the Mardi Gras ball The particular Jellybean patch which produced the protagonist of this history lies somewhere between the two—a little city of forty thousand that has dozed sleepily for forty thousand years in southern Georgia occasionally stirring in its slumbers and muttering something about a war that took place sometime somewhere and that everyone else has forgotten long ago Jim was a Jellybean I write that again because it has such a pleasant sound—rather like the beginning of a fairy story—as if Jim were nice It somehow gives me a picture of him with a round appetizing face and all sort of leaves and vegetables growing out of his cap But Jim was long and thin and bent at the waist from stooping over pooltables and he was what might have been known in the indiscriminating North as a corner loafer Jellybean is the name throughout the undissolved Confederacy for one who spends his life conjugating the verb to idle in the first person singular—I am idling I have idled I will idle Jim was born in a white house on a green corner It had four weatherbeaten pillars in front and a great amount of latticework in the rear that made a cheerful crisscross background for a flowery sundrenched lawn Originally the dwellers in the white house had owned the ground next door and next door to that and next door to that but this had been so long ago that even Jim's father scarcely remembered it He had in fact thought it a matter of so little moment that when he was dying from a pistol wound got in a brawl he neglected even to tell little Jim who was five years old and miserably frightened The white house became a boardinghouse run by a tightlipped lady from Macon whom Jim called Aunt Mamie and detested with all his soul He became fifteen went to high school wore his hair in black snarls and was afraid of girls He hated his home where four women and one old man prolonged an interminable chatter from summer to summer about what lots the Powell place had originally included and what sorts of flowers would be out next Sometimes the parents of little girls in town remembering Jim's mother and fancying a resemblance in the dark eyes and hair invited him to parties but parties made him shy and he much preferred sitting on a disconnected axle in Tilly's Garage rolling the bones or exploring his mouth endlessly with a long straw For pocket money he picked up odd jobs and it was due to this that he stopped going to parties At his third party little Marjorie Haight had whispered indiscreetly and within hearing distance that he was a boy who brought the groceries sometimes So instead of the twostep and polka Jim had learned to throw any number he desired on the dice and had listened to spicy tales of all the shootings that had occurred in the surrounding country during the past fifty years He became eighteen The war broke out and he enlisted as a gob and polished brass in the Charleston Navyyard for a year Then by way of variety he went North and polished brass in the Brooklyn Navyyard for a year When the war was over he came home He was twentyone has trousers were too short and too tight His buttoned shoes were long and narrow His tie was an alarming conspiracy of purple and pink marvellously scrolled and over it were two blue eyes faded like a piece of very good old cloth long exposed to the sun In the twilight of one April evening when a soft gray had drifted down along the cottonfields and over the sultry town he was a vague figure leaning against a board fence whistling and gazing at the moon's rim above the lights of Jackson Street His mind was working persistently on a problem that had held his attention for an The Jellybean had been invited to a party Back in the days when all the boys had detested all the girls Clark Darrow and Jim had sat side by side in school But while Jim's social aspirations had died in the oily air of the garage Clark had alternately fallen in and out of love gone to college taken to drink given it up and in short become one of the best beaux of the town Nevertheless Clark and Jim had retained a friendship that though casual was perfectly definite That afternoon Clark's ancient Ford had slowed up beside Jim who was on the sidewalk and out of a clear sky Clark invited him to a party at the country club The impulse that made him do this was no stranger than the impulse which made Jim accept The latter was probably an unconscious ennui a halffrightened sense of adventure And now Jim was soberly thinking it over He began to sing drumming his long foot idly on a stone block in the sidewalk till it wobbled up and down in time to the low throaty tune One smile from Home in Jellybean town Lives Jeanne the Jellybean Queen She loves her dice and treats 'em nice No dice would treat her mean He broke off and agitated the sidewalk to a bumpy gallop Daggone he muttered half aloud They would all be there—the old crowd the crowd to which by right of the white house sold long since and the portrait of the officer in gray over the mantel Jim should have belonged But that crowd had grown up together into a tight little set as gradually as the girls' dresses had lengthened inch by inch as definitely as the boys' trousers had dropped suddenly to their ankles And to that society of first names and dead puppy loves Jim was an outsider—a running mate of poor whites Most of the men knew him condescendingly he tipped his hat to three or four girls That was all When the dusk had thickened into a blue setting for the moon he walked through the hot pleasantly pungent town to Jackson Street The stores were closing and the last shoppers were drifting homeward as if borne on the dreamy revolution of a slow merrygoround A streetfair farther down a brilliant alley of varicolored booths and contributed a blend of music to the night—an oriental dance on a calliope a melancholy bugle in front of a freak show a cheerful rendition of Back Home in Tennessee on a handorgan The Jellybean stopped in a store and bought a collar Then he sauntered along toward Soda Sam's where he found the usual three or four cars of a summer evening parked in front and the little darkies running back and forth with sundaes and lemonades Hello Jim It was a voice at his elbow—Joe Ewing sitting in an automobile with Marylyn Wade Nancy Lamar and a strange man were in the back seat The Jellybean tipped his hat quickly Hi Ben— then after an almost imperceptible pause—How y' all Passing he ambled on toward the garage where he had a room upstairs His How y'all had been said to Nancy Lamar to whom he had not spoken in fifteen years Nancy had a mouth like a remembered kiss and shadowy eyes and blueblack hair inherited from her mother who had been born in Budapest Jim passed her often on the street walking smallboy fashion with her hands in her pockets and he knew that with her inseparable Sally Carrol Hopper she had left a trail of broken hearts from Atlanta to New Orleans For a few fleeting moments Jim wished he could dance Then he laughed and as he reached his door began to sing softly to himself Her Jelly Roll can twist your soul Her eyes are big and brown She's the Queen of the Queens of the Jellybeans— My Jeanne of Jellybean Town At ninethirty Jim and Clark met in front of Soda Sam's and started for the Country Club in Clark's Ford Jim asked Clark casually as they rattled through the jasminescented night how do you keep alive The Jellybean paused considered Well he said finally I got a room over Tilly's garage I help him some with the cars in the afternoon an' he gives it to me free Sometimes I drive one of his taxies and pick up a little thataway I get fed up doin' that regular though That all Well when there's a lot of work I help him by the day—Saturdays usually—and then there's one main source of revenue I don't generally mention Maybe you don't recollect I'm about the champion crapshooter of this town They make me shoot from a cup now because once I get the feel of a pair of dice they just roll for me Clark grinned appreciatively I never could learn to set 'em so's they'd do what I wanted Wish you'd shoot with Nancy Lamar some day and take all her money away from her She will roll 'em with the boys and she loses more than her daddy can afford to give her I happen to know she sold a good ring last month to pay a debt The Jellybean was noncommittal The white house on Elm Street still belong to you Jim shook his head Sold Got a pretty good price seein' it wasn't in a good part of town no more Lawyer told me to put it into Liberty bonds But Aunt Mamie got so she didn't have no sense so it takes all the interest to keep her up at Great Farms Sanitarium Hm I got an old uncle upstate an' I reckin I kin go up there if ever I get sure enough pore Nice farm but not enough niggers around to work it He's asked me to come up and help him but I don't guess I'd take much to it Too doggone lonesome— He broke off suddenly Clark I want to tell you I'm much obliged to you for askin' me out but I'd be a lot happier if you'd just stop the car right here an' let me walk back into town Shucks Clark grunted Do you good to step out You don't have to dance—just get out there on the floor and shake Hold on exclaimed Jim uneasily Don't you go leadin' me up to any girls and leavin' me there so I'll have to dance with 'em Clark laughed 'Cause continued Jim desperately without you swear you won't do that I'm agoin' to get out right here an' my good legs goin' carry me back to Jackson street They agreed after some argument that Jim unmolested by females was to view the spectacle from a secluded settee in the corner where Clark would join him whenever he wasn't dancing So ten o'clock found the Jellybean with his legs crossed and his arms conservatively folded trying to look casually at home and politely uninterested in the dancers At heart he was torn between overwhelming selfconsciousness and an intense curiosity as to all that went on around him He saw the girls emerge one by one from the dressingroom stretching and pluming themselves like bright birds smiling over their powdered shoulders at the chaperones casting a quick glance around to take in the room and simultaneously the room's reaction to their entrance—and then again like birds alighting and nestling in the sober arms of their waiting escorts Sally Carrol Hopper blonde and lazyeyed appeared clad in her favorite pink and blinking like an awakened rose Marjorie Haight Marylyn Wade Harriet Cary all the girls he had seen loitering down Jackson Street by noon now curled and brilliantined and delicately tinted for the overhead lights were miraculously strange Dresden figures of pink and blue and red and gold fresh from the shop and not yet fully dried He had been there half an hour totally uncheered by Clark's jovial visits which were each one accompanied by a Hello old boy how you making out and a slap at his knee A dozen males had spoken to him or stopped for a moment beside him but he knew that they were each one surprised at finding him there and fancied that one or two were even slightly resentful But at half past ten his embarrassment suddenly left him and a pull of breathless interest took him completely out of himself—Nancy Lamar had come out of the dressingroom She was dressed in yellow organdie a costume of a hundred cool corners with three tiers of ruffles and a big bow in back until she shed black and yellow around her in a sort of phosphorescent lustre The Jellybean's eyes opened wide and a lump arose in his throat For she stood beside the door until her partner hurried up Jim recognized him as the stranger who had been with her in Joe Ewing's car that afternoon He saw her set her arms akimbo and say something in a low voice and laugh The man laughed too and Jim experienced the quick pang of a weird new kind of pain Some ray had passed between the pair a shaft of beauty from that sun that had warmed him a moment since The Jellybean felt suddenly like a weed in a shadow A minute later Clark approached him brighteyed and glowing Hi old man he cried with some lack of originality How you making out Jim replied that he was making out as well as could be expected You come along with me commanded Clark I've got something that'll put an edge on the evening Jim followed him awkwardly across the floor and up the stairs to the lockerroom where Clark produced a flask of nameless yellow liquid Good old corn Ginger ale arrived on a tray Such potent nectar as good old corn needed some disguise beyond seltzer Say boy exclaimed Clark breathlessly doesn't Nancy Lamar look beautiful Jim nodded Mighty beautiful he agreed She's all dolled up to a fareyouwell tonight continued Clark Notice that fellow she's with Big fella White pants Yeah Well that's Ogden Merritt from Savannah Old man Merritt makes the Merritt safety razors This fella's crazy about her Been chasing after her all year She's a wild baby continued Clark but I like her So does everybody But she sure does do crazy stunts She usually gets out alive but she's got scars all over her reputation from one thing or another she's done That so Jim passed over his glass That's good corn Not so bad Oh she's a wild one Shoot craps say boy And she do like her highballs Promised I'd give her one later on She in love with this—Merritt Damned if I know Seems like all the best girls around here marry fellas and go off somewhere He poured himself one more drink and carefully corked the bottle Listen Jim I got to go dance and I'd be much obliged if you just stick this corn right on your hip as long as you're not dancing If a man notices I've had a drink he'll come up and ask me and before I know it it's all gone and somebody else is having my good time So Nancy Lamar was going to marry This toast of a town was to become the private property of an individual in white trousers—and all because white trousers' father had made a better razor than his neighbor As they descended the stairs Jim found the idea inexplicably depressing For the first time in his life he felt a vague and romantic yearning A picture of her began to form in his imagination—Nancy walking boylike and debonnaire along the street taking an orange as tithe from a worshipful fruitdealer charging a dope on a mythical account at Soda Sam's assembling a convoy of beaux and then driving off in triumphal state for an afternoon of splashing and singing The Jellybean walked out on the porch to a deserted corner dark between the moon on the lawn and the single lighted door of the ballroom There he found a chair and lighting a cigarette drifted into the thoughtless reverie that was his usual mood Yet now it was a reverie made sensuous by the night and by the hot smell of damp powder puffs tucked in the fronts of low dresses and distilling a thousand rich scents to float out through the open door The music itself blurred by a loud trombone became hot and shadowy a languorous overtone to the scraping of many shoes and slippers Suddenly the square of yellow light that fell through the door was obscured by a dark figure A girl had come out of the dressingroom and was standing on the porch not more than ten feet away Jim heard a lowbreathed doggone and then she turned and saw him It was Nancy Lamar Jim rose to his feet Howdy Hello— she paused hesitated and then approached Oh it's—Jim Powell He bowed slightly tried to think of a casual remark Do you suppose she began quickly I mean—do you know anything about gum What I've got gum on my shoe Some utter ass left his or her gum on the floor and of course I stepped in it Jim blushed inappropriately Do you know how to get it off she demanded petulantly I've tried a knife I've tried every damn thing in the dressingroom I've tried soap and water—and even perfume and I've ruined my powderpuff trying to make it stick to that Jim considered the question in some agitation Why—I think maybe gasolene— The words had scarcely left his lips when she grasped his hand and pulled him at a run off the low veranda over a flower bed and at a gallop toward a group of cars parked in the moonlight by the first hole of the golf course Turn on the gasolene she commanded breathlessly What For the gum of course I've got to get it off I can't dance with gum on Obediently Jim turned to the cars and began inspecting them with a view to obtaining the desired solvent Had she demanded a cylinder he would have done his best to wrench one out Here he said after a moment's search 'Here's one that's easy Got a handkerchief It's upstairs wet I used it for the soap and water Jim laboriously explored his pockets Don't believe I got one either Doggone it Well we can turn it on and let it run on the ground He turned the spout a dripping began More He turned it on fuller The dripping became a flow and formed an oily pool that glistened brightly reflecting a dozen tremulous moons on its quivering bosom Ah she sighed contentedly let it all out The only thing to do is to wade in it In desperation he turned on the tap full and the pool suddenly widened sending tiny rivers and trickles in all directions That's fine That's something like Raising her skirts she stepped gracefully in I know this'll take it off she murmured Jim smiled There's lots more cars She stepped daintily out of the gasolene and began scraping her slippers side and bottom on the runningboard of the automobile The jellybean contained himself no longer He bent double with explosive laughter and after a second she joined in You're here with Clark Darrow aren't you she asked as they walked back toward the veranda Yes You know where he is now Out dancin' I reckin The deuce He promised me a highball Well said Jim I guess that'll be all right I got his bottle right here in my pocket She smiled at him radiantly I guess maybe you'll need ginger ale though he added Not me Just the bottle Sure enough She laughed scornfully Try me I can drink anything any man can Let's sit down She perched herself on the side of a table and he dropped into one of the wicker chairs beside her Taking out the cork she held the flask to her lips and took a long drink He watched her fascinated Like it She shook her head breathlessly No but I like the way it makes me feel I think most people are that way Jim agreed My daddy liked it too well It got him American men said Nancy gravely don't know how to drink What Jim was startled In fact she went on carelessly they don't know how to do anything very well The one thing I regret in my life is that I wasn't born in England In England Yes It's the one regret of my life that I wasn't Do you like it over there Yes Immensely I've never been there in person but I've met a lot of Englishmen who were over here in the army Oxford and Cambridge men—you know that's like Sewanee and University of Georgia are here—and of course I've read a lot of English novels Jim was interested amazed D' you ever hear of Lady Diana Manner she asked earnestly No Jim had not Well she's what I'd like to be Dark you know like me and wild as sin She's the girl who rode her horse up the steps of some cathedral or church or something and all the novelists made their heroines do it afterwards Jim nodded politely He was out of his depths Pass the bottle suggested Nancy I'm going to take another little one A little drink wouldn't hurt a baby You see she continued again breathless after a draught People over there have style Nobody has style here I mean the boys here aren't really worth dressing up for or doing sensational things for Don't you know I suppose so—I mean I suppose not murmured Jim And I'd like to do 'em an' all I'm really the only girl in town that has style She stretched out her arms and yawned pleasantly Pretty evening Sure is agreed Jim Like to have boat she suggested dreamily Like to sail out on a silver lake say the Thames for instance Have champagne and caviare sandwiches along Have about eight people And one of the men would jump overboard to amuse the party and get drowned like a man did with Lady Diana Manners once Did he do it to please her Didn't mean drown himself to please her He just meant to jump overboard and make everybody laugh I reckin they just died laughin' when he drowned Oh I suppose they laughed a little she admitted I imagine she did anyway She's pretty hard I guess—like I am You hard Like nails She yawned again and added Give me a little more from that bottle Jim hesitated but she held out her hand defiantly Don't treat me like a girl she warned him I'm not like any girl you ever saw She considered Still perhaps you're right You got—you got old head on young shoulders She jumped to her feet and moved toward the door The Jellybean rose also Goodbye she said politely goodbye Thanks Jellybean Then she stepped inside and left him wideeyed upon the porch At twelve o'clock a procession of cloaks issued single file from the women's dressingroom and each one pairing with a coated beau like dancers meeting in a cotillion figure drifted through the door with sleepy happy laughter—through the door into the dark where autos backed and snorted and parties called to one another and gathered around the watercooler Jim sitting in his corner rose to look for Clark They had met at eleven then Clark had gone in to dance So seeking him Jim wandered into the softdrink stand that had once been a bar The room was deserted except for a sleepy negro dozing behind the counter and two boys lazily fingering a pair of dice at one of the tables Jim was about to leave when he saw Clark coming in At the same moment Clark looked up Hi Jim he commanded C'mon over and help us with this bottle I guess there's not much left but there's one all around Nancy the man from Savannah Marylyn Wade and Joe Ewing were lolling and laughing in the doorway Nancy caught Jim's eye and winked at him humorously They drifted over to a table and arranging themselves around it waited for the waiter to bring ginger ale Jim faintly ill at ease turned his eyes on Nancy who had drifted into a nickel crap game with the two boys at the next table Bring them over here suggested Clark Joe looked around We don't want to draw a crowd It's against club rules Nobody's around insisted Clark except Mr Taylor He's walking up and down like a wildman trying find out who let all the gasolene out of his car There was a general laugh I bet a million Nancy got something on her shoe again You can't park when she's around O Nancy Mr Taylor's looking for you Nancy's cheeks were glowing with excitement over the game I haven't seen his silly little flivver in two weeks Jim felt a sudden silence He turned and saw an individual of uncertain age standing in the doorway Clark's voice punctuated the embarrassment Won't you join us Mr Taylor Thanks Mr Taylor spread his unwelcome presence over a chair Have to I guess I'm waiting till they dig me up some gasolene Somebody got funny with my car His eyes narrowed and he looked quickly from one to the other Jim wondered what he had heard from the doorway—tried to remember what had been said I'm right tonight Nancy sang out and my four bits is in the ring Faded snapped Taylor suddenly Why Mr Taylor I didn't know you shot craps Nancy was overjoyed to find that he had seated himself and instantly covered her bet They had openly disliked each other since the night she had definitely discouraged a series of rather pointed advances All right babies do it for your mamma Just one little seven Nancy was cooing to the dice She rattled them with a brave underhand flourish and rolled them out on the table Ahh I suspected it And now again with the dollar up Five passes to her credit found Taylor a bad loser She was making it personal and after each success Jim watched triumph flutter across her face She was doubling with each throw—such luck could scarcely last Better go easy he cautioned her timidly Ah but watch this one she whispered It was eight on the dice and she called her number Little Ada this time we're going South Ada from Decatur rolled over the table Nancy was flushed and halfhysterical but her luck was holding She drove the pot up and up refusing to drag Taylor was drumming with his fingers on the table but he was in to stay Then Nancy tried for a ten and lost the dice Taylor seized them avidly He shot in silence and in the hush of excitement the clatter of one pass after another on the table was the only sound Now Nancy had the dice again but her luck had broken An hour passed Back and forth it went Taylor had been at it again—and again and again They were even at last—Nancy lost her ultimate five dollars Will you take my check she said quickly for fifty and we'll shoot it all Her voice was a little unsteady and her hand shook as she reached to the money Clark exchanged an uncertain but alarmed glance with Joe Ewing Taylor shot again He had Nancy's check How 'bout another she said wildly Jes' any bank'll do—money everywhere as a matter of fact Jim understood—the good old corn he had given her—the good old corn she had taken since He wished he dared interfere—a girl of that age and position would hardly have two bank accounts When the clock struck two he contained himself no longer May I—can't you let me roll 'em for you he suggested his low lazy voice a little strained Suddenly sleepy and listless Nancy flung the dice down before him All right—old boy As Lady Diana Manners says 'Shoot 'em Jellybean'—My luck's gone Mr Taylor said Jim carelessly we'll shoot for one of those there checks against the cash Half an hour later Nancy swayed forward and clapped him on the back Stole my luck you did She was nodding her head sagely Jim swept up the last check and putting it with the others tore them into confetti and scattered them on the floor Someone started singing and Nancy kicking her chair backward rose to her feet Ladies and gentlemen she announced Ladies—that's you Marylyn I want to tell the world that Mr Jim Powell who is a wellknown Jellybean of this city is an exception to the great rule—'lucky in dice—unlucky in love' He's lucky in dice and as matter of fact I—I love him Ladies and gentlemen Nancy Lamar famous darkhaired beauty often featured in the Herald as one the most popular members of younger set as other girls are often featured in this particular case Wish to announce—wish to announce anyway Gentlemen— She tipped suddenly Clark caught her and restored her balance My error she laughed she—stoops to—stoops to—anyways—We'll drink to Jellybean Mr Jim Powell King of the Jellybeans And a few minutes later as Jim waited hat in hand for Clark in the darkness of that same corner of the porch where she had come searching for gasolene she appeared suddenly beside him Jellybean she said are you here Jellybean I think— and her slight unsteadiness seemed part of an enchanted dream—I think you deserve one of my sweetest kisses for that Jellybean For an instant her arms were around his neck—her lips were pressed to his I'm a wild part of the world Jellybean but you did me a good turn Then she was gone down the porch over the cricketloud lawn Jim saw Merritt come out the front door and say something to her angrily—saw her laugh and turning away walk with averted eyes to his car Marylyn and Joe followed singing a drowsy song about a Jazz baby Clark came out and joined Jim on the steps All pretty lit I guess he yawned Merritt's in a mean mood He's certainly off Nancy Over east along the golf course a faint rug of gray spread itself across the feet of the night The party in the car began to chant a chorus as the engine warmed up Goodnight everybody called Clark Goodnight Clark Goodnight There was a pause and then a soft happy voice added Goodnight Jellybean The car drove off to a burst of singing A rooster on a farm across the way took up a solitary mournful crow and behind them a last negro waiter turned out the porch light Jim and Clark strolled over toward the Ford their shoes crunching raucously on the gravel drive Oh boy sighed Clark softly how you can set those dice It was still too dark for him to see the flush on Jim's thin cheeks—or to know that it was a flush of unfamiliar shame Over Tilly's garage a bleak room echoed all day to the rumble and snorting downstairs and the singing of the negro washers as they turned the hose on the cars outside It was a cheerless square of a room punctuated with a bed and a battered table on which lay half a dozen books—Joe Miller's Slow Train thru Arkansas Lucille in an old edition very much annotated in an oldfashioned hand The Eyes of the World by Harold Bell Wright and an ancient prayerbook of the Church of England with the name Alice Powell and the date 1831 written on the flyleaf The East gray when Jellybean entered the garage became a rich and vivid blue as he turned on his solitary electric light He snapped it out again and going to the window rested his elbows on the sill and stared into the deepening morning With the awakening of his emotions his first perception was a sense of futility a dull ache at the utter grayness of his life A wall had sprung up suddenly around him hedging him in a wall as definite and tangible as the white wall of his bare room And with his perception of this wall all that had been the romance of his existence the casualness the lighthearted improvidence the miraculous openhandedness of life faded out The Jellybean strolling up Jackson Street humming a lazy song known at every shop and street stand cropful of easy greeting and local wit sad sometimes for only the sake of sadness and the flight of time—that Jellybean was suddenly vanished The very name was a reproach a triviality With a flood of insight he knew that Merritt must despise him that even Nancy's kiss in the dawn would have awakened not jealousy but only a contempt for Nancy's so lowering herself And on his part the Jellybean had used for her a dingy subterfuge learned from the garage He had been her moral laundry the stains were his As the gray became blue brightened and filled the room he crossed to his bed and threw himself down on it gripping the edges fiercely I love her he cried aloud God As he said this something gave way within him like a lump melting in his throat The air cleared and became radiant with dawn and turning over on his face he began to sob dully into the pillow In the sunshine of three o'clock Clark Darrow chugging painfully along Jackson Street was hailed by the Jellybean who stood on the curb with his fingers in his vest pockets Hi called Clark bringing his Ford to an astonishing stop alongside Just get up The Jellybean shook his head Never did go to bed Felt sorta restless so I took a long walk this morning out in the country Just got into town this minute Should think you would feel restless I been feeling thataway all day— I'm thinkin' of leavin' town continued the Jellybean absorbed by his own thoughts Been thinkin' of goin' up on the farm and takin' a little that work off Uncle Dun Reckin I been bummin' too long Clark was silent and the Jellybean continued I reckin maybe after Aunt Mamie dies I could sink that money of mine in the farm and make somethin' out of it All my people originally came from that part up there Had a big place Clark looked at him curiously That's funny he said This—this sort of affected me the same way The Jellybean hesitated I don't know he began slowly somethin' about—about that girl last night talkin' about a lady named Diana Manners—an English lady sorta got me thinkin' He drew himself up and looked oddly at Clark I had a family once he said defiantly Clark nodded I know And I'm the last of 'em continued the Jellybean his voice rising slightly and I ain't worth shucks Name they call me by means jelly—weak and wobbly like People who weren't nothin' when my folks was a lot turn up their noses when they pass me on the street Again Clark was silent So I'm through I'm goin' today And when I come back to this town it's going to be like a gentleman Clark took out his handkerchief and wiped his damp brow Reckon you're not the only one it shook up he admitted gloomily All this thing of girls going round like they do is going to stop right quick Too bad too but everybody'll have to see it thataway Do you mean demanded Jim in surprise that all that's leaked out Leaked out How on earth could they keep it secret It'll be announced in the papers tonight Doctor Lamar's got to save his name somehow Jim put his hands on the sides of the car and tightened his long fingers on the metal Do you mean Taylor investigated those checks It was Clark's turn to be surprised Haven't you heard what happened Jim's startled eyes were answer enough Why announced Clark dramatically those four got another bottle of corn got tight and decided to shock the town—so Nancy and that fella Merritt were married in Rockville at seven o'clock this morning A tiny indentation appeared in the metal under the Jellybean's fingers Married Sure enough Nancy sobered up and rushed back into town crying and frightened to death—claimed it'd all been a mistake First Doctor Lamar went wild and was going to kill Merritt but finally they got it patched up some way and Nancy and Merritt went to Savannah on the twothirty train Jim closed his eyes and with an effort overcame a sudden sickness It's too bad said Clark philosophically I don't mean the wedding—reckon that's all right though I don't guess Nancy cared a darn about him But it's a crime for a nice girl like that to hurt her family that way The Jellybean let go the car and turned away Again something was going on inside him some inexplicable but almost chemical change Where you going asked Clark The Jellybean turned and looked dully back over his shoulder Got to go he muttered Been up too long feelin' right sick Oh *⁠*⁠* The street was hot at three and hotter still at four the April dust seeming to enmesh the sun and give it forth again as a worldold joke forever played on an eternity of afternoons But at half past four a first layer of quiet fell and the shades lengthened under the awnings and heavy foliaged trees In this heat nothing mattered All life was weather a waiting through the hot where events had no significance for the cool that was soft and caressing like a woman's hand on a tired forehead Down in Georgia there is a feeling—perhaps inarticulate—that this is the greatest wisdom of the South—so after a while the Jellybean turned into a poolhall on Jackson Street where he was sure to find a congenial crowd who would make all the old jokes—the ones he knew THE CAMEL'S BACK The glazed eye of the tired reader resting for a second on the above title will presume it to be merely metaphorical Stories about the

there took place in Toledo counting only the people with the italicized the fortyone dinner parties sixteen dances six luncheons male and female twelve teas four stag dinners two weddings and thirteen bridge parties It was the cumulative effect of all this that moved Perry Parkhurst on the twentyninth day of December to a decision This Medill girl would marry him and she wouldn't marry him She was having such a good time that she hated to take such a definite step Meanwhile their secret engagement had got so long that it seemed as if any day it might break off of its own weight A little man named Warburton who knew it all persuaded Perry to superman her to get a marriage license and go up to the Medill house and tell her she'd have to marry him at once or call it off forever So he presented himself his heart his license and his ultimatum and within five minutes they were in the midst of a violent quarrel a burst of sporadic open fighting such as occurs near the end of all long wars and engagements It brought about one of those ghastly lapses in which two people who are in love pull up sharp look at each other coolly and think it's all been a mistake Afterward they usually kiss wholesomely and assure the other person it was all their fault Say it all was my fault Say it was I want to hear you say it But while reconciliation was trembling in the air while each was in a measure stalling it off so that they might the more voluptuously and sentimentally enjoy it when it came they were permanently interrupted by a twentyminute phone call for Betty from a garrulous aunt At the end of eighteen minutes Perry Parkhurst urged on by pride and suspicion and injured dignity put on his long fur coat picked up his light brown soft hat and stalked out the door It's all over he muttered brokenly as he tried to jam his car into first It's all over—if I have to choke you for an hour damn you The last to the car which had been standing some time and was quite cold He drove downtown—that is he got into a snow rut that led him downtown He sat slouched down very low in his seat much too dispirited to care where he went In front of the Clarendon Hotel he was hailed from the sidewalk by a bad man named Baily who had big teeth and lived at the hotel and had never been in love Perry said the bad man softly when the roadster drew up beside him at the curb I've got six quarts of the doggonedest still champagne you ever tasted A third of it's yours Perry if you'll come upstairs and help Martin Macy and me drink it Baily said Perry tensely I'll drink your champagne I'll drink every drop of it I don't care if it kills me Shut up you nut said the bad man gently They don't put wood alcohol in champagne This is the stuff that proves the world is more than six thousand years old It's so ancient that the cork is petrified You have to pull it with a stone drill Take me upstairs said Perry moodily If that cork sees my heart it'll fall out from pure mortification The room upstairs was full of those innocent hotel pictures of little girls eating apples and sitting in swings and talking to dogs The other decorations were neckties and a pink man reading a pink paper devoted to ladies in pink tights When you have to go into the highways and byways—— said the pink man looking reproachfully at Baily and Perry Hello Martin Macy said Perry shortly where's this stoneage champagne What's the rush This isn't an operation understand This is a party Perry sat down dully and looked disapprovingly at all the neckties Baily leisurely opened the door of a wardrobe and brought out six handsome bottles Take off that darn fur coat said Martin Macy to Perry Or maybe you'd like to have us open all the windows Give me champagne said Perry Going to the Townsends' circus ball tonight Am not 'Vited Uhhuh Why not go Oh I'm sick of parties exclaimed Perry I'm sick of 'em I've been to so many that I'm sick of 'em Maybe you're going to the Howard Tates' party No I tell you I'm sick of 'em Well said Macy consolingly the Tates' is just for college kids anyways I tell you—— I thought you'd be going to one of 'em anyways I see by the papers you haven't missed a one this Christmas Hm grunted Perry morosely He would never go to any more parties Classical phrases played in his mind—that side of his life was closed closed Now when a man says closed closed like that you can be pretty sure that some woman has doubleclosed him so to speak Perry was also thinking that other classical thought about how cowardly suicide is A noble thought that one—warm and inspiring Think of all the fine men we should lose if suicide were not so cowardly An hour later was six o'clock and Perry had lost all resemblance to the young man in the liniment advertisement He looked like a rough draft for a riotous cartoon They were singing—an impromptu song of Baily's improvisation One Lump Perry the parlor snake Famous through the city for the way he drinks his tea Plays with it toys with it Makes no noise with it Balanced on a napkin on his welltrained knee— Trouble is said Perry who had just banged his hair with Baily's comb and was tying an orange tie round it to get the effect of Julius Caesar that you fellas can't sing worth a damn Soon's I leave the air and start singing tenor you start singin' tenor too 'M a natural tenor said Macy gravely Voice lacks cultivation tha's all Gotta natural voice m'aunt used say Naturally good singer Singers singers all good singers remarked Baily who was at the telephone No not the cabaret I want night egg I mean some doggone clerk 'at's got food—food I want—— Julius Caesar announced Perry turning round from the mirror Man of iron will and stern 'termination Shut up yelled Baily Say iss Mr Baily Sen' up enormous supper Use y'own judgment Right away He connected the receiver and the hook with some difficulty and then with his lips closed and an expression of solemn intensity in his eyes went to the lower drawer of his dresser and pulled it open Lookit he commanded In his hands he held a truncated garment of pink gingham Pants he exclaimed gravely Lookit This was a pink blouse a red tie and a Buster Brown collar Lookit he repeated Costume for the Townsends' circus ball I'm li'l' boy carries water for the elephants Perry was impressed in spite of himself I'm going to be Julius Caesar he announced after a moment of concentration Thought you weren't going said Macy Me Sure I'm goin' Never miss a party Good for the nerves—like celery Caesar scoffed Baily Can't be Caesar He is not about a circus Caesar's Shakespeare Go as a clown Perry shook his head Nope Caesar Caesar Sure Chariot Light dawned on Baily That's right Good idea Perry looked round the room searchingly You lend me a bathrobe and this tie he said finally Baily considered No good Sure tha's all I need Caesar was a savage They can't kick if I come as Caesar if he was a savage No said Baily shaking his head slowly Get a costume over at a costumer's Over at Nolak's Closed up Find out After a puzzling five minutes at the phone a small weary voice managed to convince Perry that it was Mr Nolak speaking and that they would remain open until eight because of the Townsends' ball Thus assured Perry ate a great amount of filet mignon and drank his third of the last bottle of champagne At eightfifteen the man in the tall hat who stands in front of the Clarendon found him trying to start his roadster Froze up said Perry wisely The cold froze it The cold air Froze eh Yes Cold air froze it Can't start it Nope Let it stand here till summer One those hot ole August days'll thaw it out awright Goin' let it stand Sure Let 'er stand Take a hot thief to steal it Gemme taxi The man in the tall hat summoned a taxi Where to mister Go to Nolak's—costume fella Mrs Nolak was short and ineffectual looking and on the cessation of the world war had belonged for a while to one of the new nationalities Owing to unsettled European conditions she had never since been quite sure what she was The shop in which she and her husband performed their daily stint was dim and ghostly and peopled with suits of armor and Chinese mandarins and enormous papiermâché birds suspended from the ceiling In a vague background many rows of masks glared eyelessly at the visitor and there were glass cases full of crowns and scepters and jewels and enormous stomachers and paints and crape hair and wigs of all colors When Perry ambled into the shop Mrs Nolak was folding up the last troubles of a strenuous day so she thought in a drawer full of pink silk stockings Something for you she queried pessimistically Want costume of Julius Hur the charioteer Mrs Nolak was sorry but every stitch of charioteer had been rented long ago Was it for the Townsends' circus ball It was Sorry she said but I don't think there's anything left that's really circus This was an obstacle Hm said Perry An idea struck him suddenly If you've got a piece of canvas I could go's a tent Sorry but we haven't anything like that A hardware store is where you'd have to go to We have some very nice Confederate soldiers No No soldiers And I have a very handsome king He shook his head Several of the gentlemen she continued hopefully are wearing stovepipe hats and swallowtail coats and going as ringmasters—but we're all out of tall hats I can let you have some crape hair for a mustache Want somep'n 'stinctive Something—let's see Well we have a lion's head and a goose and a camel— Camel The idea seized Perry's imagination gripped it fiercely Yes but It needs two people Camel That's the idea Lemme see it The camel was produced from his resting place on a top shelf At first glance he appeared to consist entirely of a very gaunt cadaverous head and a sizable hump but on being spread out he was found to possess a dark brown unwholesomelooking body made of thick cottony cloth You see it takes two people explained Mrs Nolak holding the camel in frank admiration If you have a friend he could be part of it You see there's sorta pants for two people One pair is for the fella in front and the other pair for the fella in back The fella in front does the lookin' out through these here eyes an' the fella in back he's just gotta stoop over an' folla the front fella round Put it on commanded Perry Obediently Mrs Nolak put her tabbycat face inside the camel's head and turned it from side to side ferociously Perry was fascinated What noise does a camel make What asked Mrs Nolak as her face emerged somewhat smudgy Oh what noise Why he sorta brays Lemme see it in a mirror Before a wide mirror Perry tried on the head and turned from side to side appraisingly In the dim light the effect was distinctly pleasing The camel's face was a study in pessimism decorated with numerous abrasions and it must be admitted that his coat was in that state of general negligence peculiar to camels—in fact he needed to be cleaned and pressed—but distinctive he certainly was He was majestic He would have attracted attention in any gathering if only by his melancholy cast of feature and the look of hunger lurking round his shadowy eyes You see you have to have two people said Mrs Nolak again Perry tentatively gathered up the body and legs and wrapped them about him tying the hind legs as a girdle round his waist The effect on the whole was bad It was even irreverent—like one of those mediaeval pictures of a monk changed into a beast by the ministrations of Satan At the very best the ensemble resembled a humpbacked cow sitting on her haunches among blankets Don't look like anything at all objected Perry gloomily No said Mrs Nolak you see you got to have two people A solution flashed upon Perry You got a date tonight Oh I couldn't possibly—— Oh come on said Perry encouragingly Sure you can Here Be good sport and climb into these hind legs With difficulty he located them and extended their yawning depths ingratiatingly But Mrs Nolak seemed loath She backed perversely away Oh no—— C'mon You can be the front if you want to Or we'll flip a coin Make it worth your while Mrs Nolak set her lips firmly together Now you just stop she said with no coyness implied None of the gentlemen ever acted up this way before My husband—— You got a husband demanded Perry Where is he He's home Wha's telephone number After considerable parley he obtained the telephone number pertaining to the Nolak penates and got into communication with that small weary voice he had heard once before that day But Mr Nolak though taken off his guard and somewhat confused by Perry's brilliant flow of logic stuck staunchly to his point He refused firmly but with dignity to help out Mr Parkhurst in the capacity of back part of a camel Having rung off or rather having been rung off on Perry sat down on a threelegged stool to think it over He named over to himself those friends on whom he might call and then his mind paused as Betty Medill's name hazily and sorrowfully occurred to him He had a sentimental thought He would ask her Their love affair was over but she could not refuse this last request Surely it was not much to ask—to help him keep up his end of social obligation for one short night And if she insisted she could be the front part of the camel and he would go as the back His magnanimity pleased him His mind even turned to rosycolored dreams of a tender reconciliation inside the camel—there hidden away from all the world Now you'd better decide right off The bourgeois voice of Mrs Nolak broke in upon his mellow fancies and roused him to action He went to the phone and called up the Medill house Miss Betty was out had gone out to dinner Then when all seemed lost the camel's back wandered curiously into the store He was a dilapidated individual with a cold in his head and a general trend about him of downwardness His cap was pulled down low on his head and his chin was pulled down low on his chest his coat hung down to his shoes he looked rundown down at the heels and—Salvation Army to the contrary—down and out He said that he was the taxicabdriver that the gentleman had hired at the Clarendon Hotel He had been instructed to wait outside but he had waited some time and a suspicion had grown upon him that the gentleman had gone out the back way with purpose to defraud him—gentlemen sometimes did—so he had come in He sank down onto the threelegged stool Wanta go to a party demanded Perry sternly I gotta work answered the taxidriver lugubriously I gotta keep my job It's a very good party 'S a very good job Come on urged Perry Be a good fella See—it's pretty He held the camel up and the taxidriver looked at it cynically Huh Perry searched feverishly among the folds of the cloth See he cried enthusiastically holding up a selection of folds This is your part You don't even have to talk All you have to do is to walk—and sit down occasionally You do all the sitting down Think of it I'm on my feet all the time and you can sit down some of the time The only time I can sit down is when we're lying down and you can sit down when—oh any time See What's 'at thing demanded the individual dubiously A shroud Not at all said Perry indignantly It's a camel Huh Then Perry mentioned a sum of money and the conversation left the land of grunts and assumed a practical tinge Perry and the taxidriver tried on the camel in front of the mirror You can't see it explained Perry peering anxiously out through the eyeholes but honestly ole man you look sim'ly great Honestly A grunt from the hump acknowledged this somewhat dubious compliment Honestly you look great repeated Perry enthusiastically Move round a little The hind legs moved forward giving the effect of a huge catcamel hunching his back preparatory to a spring No move sideways The camel's hips went neatly out of joint a hula dancer would have writhed in envy Good isn't it demanded Perry turning to Mrs Nolak for approval It looks lovely agreed Mrs Nolak We'll take it said Perry The bundle was stowed under Perry's arm and they left the shop Go to the party he commanded as he took his seat in the back What party Fanzydress party Where'bouts is it This presented a new problem Perry tried to remember but the names of all those who had given parties during the holidays danced confusedly before his eyes He could ask Mrs Nolak but on looking out the window he saw that the shop was dark Mrs Nolak had already faded out a little black smudge far down the snowy street Drive uptown directed Perry with fine confidence If you see a party stop Otherwise I'll tell you when we get there He fell into a hazy daydream and his thoughts wandered again to Betty—he imagined vaguely that they had had a disagreement because she refused to go to the party as the back part of the camel He was just slipping off into a chilly doze when he was wakened by the taxidriver opening the door and shaking him by the arm Here we are maybe Perry looked out sleepily A striped awning led from the curb up to a spreading gray stone house from which issued the low drummy whine of expensive jazz He recognized the Howard Tate house Sure he said emphatically 'at's it Tate's party tonight Sure everybody's goin' Say said the individual anxiously after another look at the awning you sure these people ain't gonna romp on me for comin' here Perry drew himself up with dignity 'F anybody says anything to you just tell 'em you're part of my costume The visualization of himself as a thing rather than a person seemed to reassure the individual All right he said reluctantly Perry stepped out under the shelter of the awning and began unrolling the camel Let's go he commanded Several minutes later a melancholy hungrylooking camel emitting clouds of smoke from his mouth and from the tip of his noble hump might have been seen crossing the threshold of the Howard Tate residence passing a startled footman without so much as a snort and heading directly for the main stairs that led up to the ballroom The beast walked with a peculiar gait which varied between an uncertain lockstep and a stampede—but can best be described by the word halting The camel had a halting gait—and as he walked he alternately elongated and contracted like a gigantic concertina The Howard Tates are as every one who lives in Toledo knows the most formidable people in town Mrs Howard Tate was a Chicago Todd before she became a Toledo Tate and the family generally affect that conscious simplicity which has begun to be the earmark of American aristocracy The Tates have reached the stage where they talk about pigs and farms and look at you icyeyed if you are not amused They have begun to prefer retainers rather than friends as dinner guests spend a lot of money in a quiet way and having lost all sense of competition are in process of growing quite dull The dance this evening was for little Millicent Tate and though all ages were represented the dancers were mostly from school and college—the younger married crowd was at the Townsends' circus ball up at the Tallyho Club Mrs Tate was standing just inside tie ballroom following Millicent round with her eyes and beaming whenever she caught her bye Beside her were two middleaged sycophants who were saying what a perfectly exquisite child Millicent was It was at this moment that Mrs Tate was grasped firmly by the skirt and her youngest daughter Emily aged eleven hurled herself with an Oof into her mother's arms Why Emily what's the trouble Mamma said Emily wildeyed but voluble there's something out on the stairs What There's a thing out on the stairs mamma I think it's a big dog mamma but it doesn't look like a dog What do you mean Emily The sycophants waved their heads sympathetically Mamma it looks like a—like a camel Mrs Tate laughed You saw a mean old shadow dear that's all No I didn't No it was some kind of thing mamma—big I was going downstairs to see if there were any more people and this dog or something he was coming upstairs Kinda funny mamma like he was lame And then he saw me and gave a sort of growl and then he slipped at the top of the landing and I ran Mrs Tate's laugh faded The child must have seen something she said The sycophants agreed that the child must have seen something—and suddenly all three women took an instinctive step away from the door as the sounds of muffled steps were audible just outside And then three startled gasps rang out as a dark brown form rounded the corner and they saw what was apparently a huge beast looking down at them hungrily Oof cried Mrs Tate Oooh cried the ladies in a chorus The camel suddenly humped his back and the gasps turned to shrieks Oh—look What is it The dancing stopped bat the dancers hurrying over got quite a different impression of the invader in fact the young people immediately suspected that it was a stunt a hired entertainer come to amuse the party The boys in long trousers looked at it rather disdainfully and sauntered over with their hands in their pockets feeling that their intelligence was being insulted But the girls uttered little shouts of glee It's a camel Well if he isn't the funniest The camel stood there uncertainly swaying slightly from side to aide and seeming to take in the room in a careful appraising glance then as if he had come to an abrupt decision he turned and ambled swiftly out the door Mr Howard Tate had just come out of the library on the lower floor and was standing chatting with a young man in the hall Suddenly they heard the noise of shouting upstairs and almost immediately a succession of bumping sounds followed by the precipitous appearance at the foot of the stairway of a large brown beast that seemed to be going somewhere in a great hurry Now what the devil said Mr Tate starting The beast picked itself up not without dignity and affecting an air of extreme nonchalance as if he had just remembered an important engagement started at a mixed gait toward the front door In fact his front legs began casually to run See here now said Mr Tate sternly Here Grab it Butterfield Grab it The young man enveloped the rear of the camel in a pair of compelling arms and realizing that further locomotion was impossible the front end submitted to capture and stood resignedly in a state of some agitation By this time a flood of young people was pouring downstairs and Mr Tate suspecting everything from an ingenious burglar to an escaped lunatic gave crisp directions to the young man Hold him Lead him in here we'll soon see The camel consented to be led into the library and Mr Tate after locking the door took a revolver from a table drawer and instructed the young man to take the thing's head off Then he gasped and returned the revolver to its hidingplace Well Perry Parkhurst he exclaimed in amazement Got the wrong party Mr Tate said Perry sheepishly Hope I didn't scare you Well—you gave us a thrill Perry Realization dawned on him You're bound for the Townsends' circus ball That's the general idea Let me introduce Mr Butterfield Mr Parkhurst Then turning to Perry Butterfield is staying with us for a few days I got a little mixed up mumbled Perry I'm very sorry Perfectly all right most natural mistake in the world I've got a clown rig and I'm going down there myself after a while He turned to Butterfield Better change your mind and come down with us The young man demurred He was going to bed Have a drink Perry suggested Mr Tate Thanks I will And say continued Tate quickly I'd forgotten all about your—friend here He indicated the rear part of the camel I didn't mean to seem discourteous Is it any one I know Bring him out It's not a friend explained Perry hurriedly I just rented him Does he drink Do you demanded Perry twisting himself tortuously round There was a faint sound of assent Sure he does said Mr Tate heartily A really efficient camel ought to be able to drink enough so it'd last him three days Tell you said Perry anxiously he isn't exactly dressed up enough to come out If you give me the bottle I can hand it back to him and he can take his inside From under the cloth was audible the enthusiastic smacking sound inspired by this suggestion When a butler had appeared with bottles glasses and siphon one of the bottles was handed back thereafter the silent partner could be heard imbibing long potations at frequent intervals Thus passed a benign hour At ten o'clock Mr Tate decided that they'd better be starting He donned his clown's costume Perry replaced the camel's head and side by side they traversed on foot the single block between the Tate house and the Tallyho Club The circus ball was in full swing A great tent fly had been put up inside the ballroom and round the walls had been built rows of booths representing the various attractions of a circus side show but these were now vacated and over the floor swarmed a shouting laughing medley of youth and color—downs bearded ladies acrobats bareback riders ringmasters tattooed men and charioteers The Townsends had determined to assure their party of success so a great quantity of liquor had been surreptitiously brought over from their house and was now flowing freely A green ribbon ran along the wall completely round the ballroom with pointing arrows alongside and signs which instructed the uninitiated to Follow the green line The green line led down to the bar where waited pure punch and wicked punch and plain darkgreen bottles On the wall above the bar was another arrow red and very wavy and under it the slogan Now follow this But even amid the luxury of costume and high spirits represented there the entrance of the camel created something of a stir and Perry was immediately surrounded by a curious laughing crowd attempting to penetrate the identity of this beast that stood by the wide doorway eying the dancers with his hungry melancholy gaze And then Perry saw Betty standing in front of a booth talking to a comic policeman She was dressed in the costume of an Egyptian snakecharmer her tawny hair was braided and drawn through brass rings the effect crowned with a glittering Oriental tiara Her fair face was stained to a warm olive glow and on her arms and the half moon of her back writhed painted serpents with single eyes of venomous green Her feet were in sandals and her skirt was slit to the knees so that when she walked one caught a glimpse of other slim serpents painted just above her bare ankles Wound about her neck was a glittering cobra Altogether a charming costume—one that caused the more nervous among the older women to shrink away from her when she passed and the more troublesome ones to make great talk about shouldn't be allowed and perfectly disgraceful But Perry peering through the uncertain eyes of the camel saw only her face radiant animated and glowing with excitement and her arms and shoulders whose mobile expressive gestures made her always the outstanding figure in any group He was fascinated and his fascination exercised a sobering effect on him With a growing clarity the events of the day came back—rage rose within him and with a halfformed intention of taking her away from the crowd he started toward her—or rather he elongated slightly for he had neglected to issue the preparatory command necessary to locomotion But at this point fickle Kismet who for a day had played with him bitterly and sardonically decided to reward him in full for the amusement he had afforded her Kismet turned the tawny eyes of the snakecharmer to the camel Kismet led her to lean toward the man beside her and say Who's that That camel Darned if I know But a little man named Warburton who knew it all found it necessary to hazard an opinion It came in with Mr Tate I think part of it's probably Warren Butterfield the architect from New York who's visiting the Tates Something stirred in Betty Medill—that ageold interest of the provincial girl in the visiting man Oh she said casually after a slight pause At the end of the next dance Betty and her partner finished up within a few feet of the camel With the informal audacity that was the keynote of the evening she reached out and gently rubbed the camel's nose Hello old camel The camel stirred uneasily You 'fraid of me said Betty lifting her eyebrows in reproof Don't be You see I'm a snakecharmer but I'm pretty good at camels too The camel bowed very low and some one made the obvious remark about beauty and the beast Mrs Townsend approached the group Well Mr Butterfield she said helpfully I wouldn't have recognised you Perry bowed again and smiled gleefully behind his mask And who is this with you she inquired Oh said Perry his voice muffled by the thick cloth and quite unrecognizable he isn't a fellow Mrs Townsend He's just part of my costume Mrs Townsend laughed and moved away Perry turned again to Betty So he thought this is how much she cares On the very day of our final rupture she starts a flirtation with another man—an absolute stranger On an impulse he gave her a soft nudge with his shoulder and waved his head suggestively toward the hall making it clear that he desired her to leave her partner and accompany him Byby Rus she called to her partner This old camel's got me Where we going Prince of Beasts The noble animal made no rejoinder but stalked gravely along in the direction of a secluded nook on the side stairs There she seated herself and the camel after some seconds of confusion which included gruff orders and sounds of a heated dispute going on in his interior placed himself beside her—his hind legs stretching out uncomfortably across two steps Well old egg said Betty cheerfully how do you like our happy party The old egg indicated that he liked it by rolling his head ecstatically and executing a gleeful kick with his hoofs This is the first time that I ever had a têteàtête with a man's valet 'round—she pointed to the hind legs—or whatever that is Oh mumbled Perry he's deaf and blind I should think you'd feel rather handicapped—you can't very well toddle even if you want to The camel hang his head lugubriously I wish you'd say something continued Betty sweetly Say you like me camel Say you think I'm beautiful Say you'd like to belong to a pretty snakecharmer The camel would Will you dance with me camel The camel would try Betty devoted half an hour to the camel She devoted at least half an hour to all visiting men It was usually sufficient When she approached a new man the current débutantes were accustomed to scatter right and left like a close column deploying before a machinegun And so to Perry Parkhurst was awarded the unique privilege of seeing his love as others saw her He was flirted with violently This paradise of frail foundation was broken into by the sounds of a general ingress to the ballroom the cotillion was beginning Betty and the camel joined the crowd her brown hand resting lightly on his shoulder defiantly symbolizing her complete adoption of him When they entered the couples were already seating themselves at tables round the walls and Mrs Townsend resplendent as a super bareback rider with rather too rotund calves was standing in the centre with the ringmaster in charge of arrangements At a signal to the band every one rose and began to dance Isn't it just slick sighed Betty Do you think you can possibly dance Perry nodded enthusiastically He felt suddenly exuberant After all he was here incognito talking to his love—he could wink patronizingly at the world So Perry danced the cotillion I say danced but that is stretching the word far beyond the wildest dreams of the jazziest terpsichorean He suffered his partner to put her hands on his helpless shoulders and pull him here and there over the floor while he hung his huge head docilely over her shoulder and made futile dummy motions with his feet His hind legs danced in a manner all their own chiefly by hopping first on one foot and then on the other Never being sure whether dancing was going on or not the hind legs played safe by going through a series of steps whenever the music started playing So the spectacle was frequently presented of the front part of the camel standing at ease and the rear keeping up a constant energetic motion calculated to rouse a sympathetic perspiration in any softhearted observer He was frequently favored He danced first with a tall lady covered with straw who announced jovially that she was a bale of hay and coyly begged him not to eat her I'd like to you're so sweet said the camel gallantly Each time the ringmaster shouted his call of Men up he lumbered ferociously for Betty with the cardboard wienerwurst or the photograph of the bearded lady or whatever the favor chanced to be Sometimes he reached her first but usually his rushes were unsuccessful and resulted in intense interior arguments For Heaven's sake Perry would snarl fiercely between his clenched teeth get a little pep I could have gotten her that time if you'd picked your feet up Well gimme a little warnin' I did darn you I can't see a doggone thing in here All you have to do is follow me It's just like dragging a load of sand round to walk with you Maybe you wanta try back hare You shut up If these people found you in this room they'd give you the worst beating you ever had They'd take your taxi license away from you Perry surprised himself by the ease with which he made this monstrous threat but it seemed to have a soporific influence on his companion for he gave out an aw gwan and subsided into abashed silence The ringmaster mounted to the top of the piano and waved his hand for silence Prizes he cried Gather round Yea Prizes Selfconsciously the circle swayed forward The rather pretty girl who had mustered the nerve to come as a bearded lady trembled with excitement thinking to be rewarded for an evening's hideousness The man who had spent the afternoon having tattoo marks painted on him skulked on the edge of the crowd blushing furiously when any one told him he was sure to get it Lady and gent performers of this circus announced the ringmaster jovially I am sure we will all agree that a good time has been had by all We will now bestow honor where honor is due by bestowing the prizes Mrs Townsend has asked me to bestow the prices Now fellow performers the first prize is for that lady who has displayed this evening the most striking becoming—at this point the bearded lady sighed resignedly—and original costume Here the bale of hay pricked up her ears Now I am sure that the decision which has been agreed upon will be unanimous with all here present The first prize goes to Miss Betty Medill the charming Egyptian snakecharmer There was a burst of applause chiefly masculine and Miss Betty Medill blushing beautifully through her olive paint was passed up to receive her award With a tender glance the ringmaster handed down to her a huge bouquet of orchids And now he continued looking round him the other prize is for that man who has the most amusing and original costume This prize goes without dispute to a guest in our midst a gentleman who is visiting here but whose stay we all hope will be long and merry—in short to the noble camel who has entertained us all by his hungry look and his brilliant dancing throughout the evening He ceased and there was a violent clapping and yeaing for it was a popular choice The prize a large box of cigars was put aside for the camel as he was anatomically unable to accept it in person And now continued the ringmaster we will wind up the cotillion with the marriage of Mirth to Folly Form for the grand wedding march the beautiful snakecharmer and the noble camel in front Betty skipped forward cheerily and wound an olive arm round the camel's neck Behind them formed the procession of little boys little girls country jakes fat ladies thin men swordswallowers wild men of Borneo and armless wonders many of them well in their cups all of them excited and happy and dazzled by the flow of light and color round them and by the familiar faces strangely unfamiliar under bizarre wigs and barbaric paint The voluptuous chords of the wedding march done in blasphemous syncopation issued in a delirious blend from the trombones and saxophones—and the march began Aren't you glad camel demanded Betty sweetly as they stepped off Aren't you glad we're going to be married and you're going to belong to the nice snakecharmer ever afterward The camel's front legs pranced expressing excessive joy Minister Minister Where's the minister cried voices out of the revel Who's going to be the clergyman The head of Jumbo obese negro waiter at the Tallyho Club for many years appeared rashly through a halfopened pantry door Oh Jumbo Get old Jumbo He's the fella Come on Jumbo How 'bout marrying us a couple Yea Jumbo was seized by four comedians stripped of his apron and escorted to a raised daïs at the head of the ball There his collar was removed and replaced back side forward with ecclesiastical effect The parade separated into two lines leaving an aisle for the bride and groom Lawdy man roared Jumbo Ah got ole Bible 'n' ev'ythin' sho nuff He produced a battered Bible from an interior pocket Yea Jumbo's got a Bible Razor too I'll bet Together the snakecharmer and the camel ascended the cheering aisle and stopped in front of Jumbo Where's yo license camel A man near by prodded Perry Give him a piece of paper Anything'll do Perry fumbled confusedly in his pocket found a folded paper and pushed it out through the camel's mouth Holding it upside down Jumbo pretended to scan it earnestly Dis yeah's a special camel's license he said Get you ring ready camel Inside the camel Perry turned round and addressed his worse half Gimme a ring for Heaven's sake I ain't got none protested a weary voice You have I saw it I ain't goin' to take it offen my hand If you don't I'll kill you There was a gasp and Perry felt a huge affair of rhinestone and brass inserted into his hand Again he was nudged from the outside Speak up I do cried Perry quickly He heard Betty's responses given in a debonair tone and even in this burlesque the sound thrilled him Then he had pushed the rhinestone through a tear in the camel's coat and was slipping it on her finger muttering ancient and historic words after Jumbo He didn't want any one to know about this ever His one idea was to slip away without having to disclose his identity for Mr Tate had so far kept his secret well A dignified young man Perry—and this might injure his infant law practice Embrace the bride Unmask camel and kiss her Instinctively his heart beat high as Betty turned to him laughingly and began to strike the cardboard muzzle He felt his selfcontrol giving way he longed to surround her with his arms and declare his identity and kiss those lips that smiled only a foot away—when suddenly the laughter and applause round them died off and a curious hush fell over the hall Perry and Betty looked up in surprise Jumbo had given vent to a huge Hello in such a startled voice that all eyes were bent on him Hello he said again He had turned round the camel's marriage license which he had been holding upside down produced spectacles and was studying it agonizingly Why he exclaimed and in the pervading silence his words were heard plainly by every one in the room this yeah's a shonuff marriage permit What Huh Say it again Jumbo Sure you can read Jumbo waved them to silence and Perry's blood burned to fire in his veins as he realized the break he had made Yassuh repeated Jumbo This yeah's a shonuff license and the pa'ties concerned one of 'em is dis yeah young lady Miz Betty Medill and th' other's Mistah Perry Pa'khurst There was a general gasp and a low rumble broke out as all eyes fell on the camel Betty shrank away from him quickly her tawny eyes giving out sparks of fury Is you Mistah Pa'khurst you camel Perry made no answer The crowd pressed up closer and stared at him He stood frozen rigid with embarrassment his cardboard face still hungry and sardonic as he regarded the ominous Jumbo Y'all bettah speak up said Jumbo slowly this yeah's a mighty serious mattah Outside mah duties at this club ah happens to be a shonuff minister in the Firs' Cullud Baptis' Church It done look to me as though y'all is gone an' got married The scene that followed will go down forever in the annals of the Tallyho Club Stout matrons fainted one hundred per cent Americans swore wildeyed débutantes babbled in lightning groups instantly formed and instantly dissolved and a great buzz of chatter virulent yet oddly subdued hummed through the chaotic ballroom Feverish youths swore they would kill Perry or Jumbo or themselves or some one and the Baptis' preacheh was besieged by a tempestuous covey of clamorous amateur lawyers asking questions making threats demanding precedents ordering the bonds annulled and especially trying to ferret out any hint of prearrangement in what had occurred In the corner Mrs Townsend was crying softly on the shoulder of Mr Howard Tate who was trying vainly to comfort her they were exchanging all my fault's volubly and voluminously Outside on a snowcovered walk Mr Cyrus Medill the Aluminum Man was being paced slowly up and down between two brawny charioteers giving vent now to a string of unrepeatables now to wild pleadings that they'd just let him get at Jumbo He was facetiously attired for the evening as a wild man of Borneo and the most exacting stagemanager would have acknowledged any improvement in casting the part to be quite impossible Meanwhile the two principals held the real centre of the stage Betty Medill—or was it Betty Parkhurst—storming furiously was surrounded by the plainer girls—the prettier ones were too busy talking about her to pay much attention to her—and over on the other side of the hall stood the camel still intact except for his headpiece which dangled pathetically on his chest Perry was earnestly engaged in making protestations of his innocence to a ring of angry puzzled men Every few minutes just as he had apparently proved his case some one would mention the marriage certificate and the inquisition would begin again A girl named Marion Cloud considered the second best belle of Toledo changed the gist of the situation by a remark she made to Betty Well she said maliciously it'll all blow over dear The courts will annul it without question Betty's angry tears dried miraculously in her eyes her lips shut tight together and she looked stonily at Marion Then she rose and scattering her sympathizers right and left walked directly across the room to Perry who stared at her in terror Again silence crept down upon the room Will you have the decency to grant me five minutes' conversation—or wasn't that included in your plans He nodded his mouth unable to form words Indicating coldly that he was to follow her she walked out into the hall with her chin uptilted and headed for the privacy of one of the little cardrooms Perry started after her but was brought to a jerky halt by the failure of his hind legs to function You stay here he commanded savagely I can't whined a voice from the hump unless you get out first and let me get out Perry hesitated but unable any longer to tolerate the eyes of the curious crowd he muttered a command and the camel moved carefully from the room on its four legs Betty was waiting for him Well she began furiously you see what you've done You and that crazy license I told you you shouldn't have gotten it My dear girl I— Don't say 'dear girl' to me Save that for your real wife if you ever get one after this disgraceful performance And don't try to pretend it wasn't all arranged You know you gave that colored waiter money You know you did Do you mean to say you didn't try to marry me No—of course— Yes you'd better admit it You tried it and now what are you going to do Do you know my father's nearly crazy It'll serve you right if he tries to kill you He'll take his gun and put some cold steel in you Even if this wed—this thing can be annulled it'll hang over me all the rest of my life Perry could not resist quoting softly 'Oh camel wouldn't you like to belong to the pretty snakecharmer for all your— Shutup cried Betty There was a pause Betty said Perry finally there's only one thing to do that will really get us out clear That's for you to marry me Marry you Yes Really it's the only— You shut up I wouldn't marry you if—if— I know If I were the last man on earth But if you care anything about your reputation— Reputation she cried You're a nice one to think about my reputation now Why didn't you think about my reputation before you hired that horrible Jumbo to—to— Perry tossed up his hands hopelessly Very well I'll do anything you want Lord knows I renounce all claims But said a new voice I don't Perry and Betty started and she put her hand to her heart For Heaven's sake what was that It's me said the camel's back In a minute Perry had whipped off the camel's skin and a lax limp object his clothes hanging on him damply his hand clenched tightly on an almost empty bottle stood defiantly before them Oh cried Betty you brought that object in here to frighten me You told me he was deaf—that awful person The camel's back sat down on a chair with a sigh of satisfaction Don't talk 'at way about me lady I ain't no person I'm your husband Husband The cry was wrung simultaneously from Betty and Perry Why sure I'm as much your husband as that gink is The smoke didn't marry you to the camel's front He married you to the whole camel Why that's my ring you got on your finger With a little yelp she snatched the ring from her finger and flung it passionately at the floor What's all this demanded Perry dazedly Jes' that you better fix me an' fix me right If you don't I'm agonna have the same claim you got to bein' married to her That's bigamy said Perry turning gravely to Betty Then came the supreme moment of Perry's evening the ultimate chance on which he risked his fortunes He rose and looked first at Betty where she sat weakly aghast at this new complication and then at the individual who swayed from side to side on his chair uncertainly menacingly Very well said Perry slowly to the individual you can have her Betty I'm going to prove to you that as far as I'm concerned our marriage was entirely accidental I'm going to renounce utterly my rights to have you as my wife and give you to—to the man whose ring you wear—your lawful husband There was a pause and four horrorstricken eyes were turned on him Goodby Betty he said brokenly Don't forget me in your newfound happiness I'm going to leave for the Far West on the morning train Think of me kindly Betty With a last glance at them he turned and his head rested on his chest as his hand touched the doorknob Goodby he repeated He turned the doorknob But at this sound the snakes and silk and tawny hair precipitated themselves violently toward him Oh Perry don't leave me Perry Perry take me with you Her tears flowed damply on his neck Calmly he folded his arms about her I don't care she cried I love you and if you can wake up a minister at this hour and have it done over again I'll go West with you Over her shoulder the front part of the camel looked at the back part of the camel—and they exchanged a particularly subtle esoteric sort of wink that only true camels can understand MAY DAY There had been a war fought and won and the great city of the conquering people was crossed with triumphal arches and vivid with thrown flowers of white red and rose All through the long spring days the returning soldiers marched up the chief highway behind the strump of drums and the joyous resonant wind of the brasses while merchants and clerks left their bickerings and figurings and crowding to the windows turned their whitebunched faces gravely upon the passing battalions Never had there been such splendor in the great city for the victorious war had brought plenty in its train and the merchants had flocked thither from the South and West with their households to taste of all the luscious feasts and witness the lavish entertainments prepared—and to buy for their women furs against the next winter and bags of golden mesh and varicolored slippers of silk and silver and rose satin and cloth of gold So gaily and noisily were the peace and prosperity impending hymned by the scribes and poets of the conquering people that more and more spenders had gathered from the provinces to drink the wine of excitement and faster and faster did the merchants dispose of their trinkets and slippers until they sent up a mighty cry for more trinkets and more slippers in order that they might give in barter what was demanded of them Some even of them flung up their hands helplessly shouting Alas I have no more slippers and alas I have no more trinkets May heaven help me for I know not what I shall do But no one listened to their great outcry for the throngs were far too busy—day by day the footsoldiers trod jauntily the highway and all exulted because the young men returning were pure and brave sound of tooth and pink of cheek and the young women of the land were virgins and comely both of face and of figure So during all this time there were many adventures that happened in the great city and of these several—or perhaps one—are here set down I At nine o'clock on the morning of the first of May 1919 a young man spoke to the room clerk at the Biltmore Hotel asking if Mr Philip Dean were registered there and if so could he be connected with Mr Dean's rooms The inquirer was dressed in a wellcut shabby suit He was small slender and darkly handsome his eyes were framed above with unusually long eyelashes and below with the blue semicircle of ill health this latter effect heightened by an unnatural glow which colored his face like a low incessant fever Mr Dean was staying there The young man was directed to a telephone at the side After a second his connection was made a sleepy voice hello'd from somewhere above Mr Dean—this very eagerly—it's Gordon Phil It's Gordon Sterrett I'm downstairs I heard you were in New York and I had a hunch you'd be here The sleepy voice became gradually enthusiastic Well how was Gordy old boy Well he certainly was surprised and tickled Would Gordy come right up for Pete's sake A few minutes later Philip Dean dressed in blue silk pajamas opened his door and the two young men greeted each other with a halfembarrassed exuberance They were both about twentyfour Yale graduates of the year before the war but there the resemblance stopped abruptly Dean was blond ruddy and rugged under his thin pajamas Everything about him radiated fitness and bodily comfort He smiled frequently showing large and prominent teeth I was going to look you up he cried enthusiastically I'm taking a couple of weeks off If you'll sit down a sec I'll be right with you Going to take a shower As he vanished into the bathroom his visitor's dark eyes roved nervously around the room resting for a moment on a great English travelling bag in the corner and on a family of thick silk shirts littered on the chairs amid impressive neckties and soft woollen socks Gordon rose and picking up one of the shirts gave it a minute examination It was of very heavy silk yellow with a pale blue stripe—and there were nearly a dozen of them He stared involuntarily at his own shirtcuffs—they were ragged and linty at the edges and soiled to a faint gray Dropping the silk shirt he held his coatsleeves down and worked the frayed shirtcuffs up till they were out of sight Then he went to the mirror and looked at himself with listless unhappy interest His tie of former glory was faded and thumbcreased—it served no longer to hide the jagged buttonholes of his collar He thought quite without amusement that only three years before he had received a scattering vote in the senior elections at college for being the bestdressed man in his class Dean emerged from the bathroom polishing his body Saw an old friend of yours last night he remarked Passed her in the lobby and couldn't think of her name to save my neck That girl you brought up to New Haven senior year Gordon started Edith Bradin That whom you mean 'At's the one Damn good looking She's still sort of a pretty doll—you know what I mean as if you touched her she'd smear He surveyed his shining self complacently in the mirror smiled faintly exposing a section of teeth She must be twentythree anyway he continued Twentytwo last month said Gordon absently What Oh last month Well I imagine she's down for the Gamma Psi dance Did you know we're having a Yale Gamma Psi dance tonight at Delmonico's You better come up Gordy Half of New Haven'll probably be there I can get you an invitation Draping himself reluctantly in fresh underwear Dean lit a cigarette and sat down by the open window inspecting his calves and knees under the morning sunshine which poured into the room Sit down Gordy he suggested and tell me all about what you've been doing and what you're doing now and everything Gordon collapsed unexpectedly upon the bed lay there inert and spiritless His mouth which habitually dropped a little open when his face was in repose became suddenly helpless and pathetic What's the matter asked Dean quickly Oh God What's the matter Every God damn thing in the world he said miserably I've absolutely gone to pieces Phil I'm all in Huh I'm all in His voice was shaking Dean scrutinized him more closely with appraising blue eyes You certainly look all shot I am I've made a hell of a mess of everything He paused I'd better start at the beginning—or will it bore you Not at all go on There was however a hesitant note in Dean's voice This trip East had been planned for a holiday—to find Gordon Sterrett in trouble exasperated him a little Go on he repeated and then added half under his breath Get it over with Well began Gordon unsteadily I got back from France in February went home to Harrisburg for a month and then came down to New York to get a job I got one—with an export company They fired me yesterday Fired you I'm coming to that Phil I want to tell you frankly You're about the only man I can turn to in a matter like this You won't mind if I just tell you frankly will you Phil Dean stiffened a bit more The pats he was bestowing on his knees grew perfunctory He felt vaguely that he was being unfairly saddled with responsibility he was not even sure he wanted to be told Though never surprised at finding Gordon Sterrett in mild difficulty there was something in this present misery that repelled him and hardened him even though it excited his curiosity Go on It's a girl Hm Dean resolved that nothing was going to spoil his trip If Gordon was going to be depressing then he'd have to see less of Gordon Her name is Jewel Hudson went on the distressed voice from the bed She used to be 'pure' I guess up to about a year ago Lived here in New York—poor family Her people are dead now and she lives with an old aunt You see it was just about the time I met her that everybody began to come back from France in droves—and all I did was to welcome the newly arrived and go on parties with 'em That's the way it started Phil just from being glad to see everybody and having them glad to see me You ought to've had more sense I know Gordon paused and then continued listlessly I'm on my own now you know and Phil I can't stand being poor Then came this darn girl She sort of fell in love with me for a while and though I never intended to get so involved I'd always seem to run into her somewhere You can imagine the sort of work I was doing for those exporting people—of course I always intended to draw do illustrating for magazines there's a pile of money in it Why didn't you You've got to buckle down if you want to make good suggested Dean with cold formalism I tried a little but my stuff's crude I've got talent Phil I can draw—but I just don't know how I ought to go to art school and I can't afford it Well things came to a crisis about a week ago Just as I was down to about my last dollar this girl began bothering me She wants some money claims she can make trouble for me if she doesn't get it Can she I'm afraid she can That's one reason I lost my job—she kept calling up the office all the time and that was sort of the last straw down there She's got a letter all written to send to my family Oh she's got me all right I've got to have some money for her There was an awkward pause Gordon lay very still his hands clenched by his side I'm all in he continued his voice trembling I'm half crazy Phil If I hadn't known you were coming East I think I'd have killed myself I want you to lend me three hundred dollars Dean's hands which had been patting his bare ankles were suddenly quiet—and the curious uncertainty playing between the two became taut and strained After a second Gordon continued I've bled the family until I'm ashamed to ask for another nickel Still Dean made no answer Jewel says she's got to have two hundred dollars Tell her where she can go Yes that sounds easy but she's got a couple of drunken letters I wrote her Unfortunately she's not at all the flabby sort of person you'd expect Dean made an expression of distaste I can't stand that sort of woman You ought to have kept away I know admitted Gordon wearily You've got to look at things as they are If you haven't got money you've got to work and stay away from women That's easy for you to say began Gordon his eyes narrowing You've got all the money in the world I most certainly have not My family keep darn close tab on what I spend Just because I have a little leeway I have to be extra careful not to abuse it He raised the blind and let in a further flood of sunshine I'm no prig Lord knows he went on deliberately I like pleasure—and I like a lot of it on a vacation like this but you're—you're in awful shape I never heard you talk just this way before You seem to be sort of bankrupt—morally as well as financially Don't they usually go together Dean shook his head impatiently There's a regular aura about you that I don't understand It's a sort of evil It's an air of worry and poverty and sleepless nights said Gordon rather defiantly I don't know Oh I admit I'm depressing I depress myself But my God Phil a week's rest and a new suit and some ready money and I'd be like—like I was Phil I can draw like a streak and you know it But half the time I haven't had the money to buy decent drawing materials—and I can't draw when I'm tired and discouraged and all in With a little ready money I can take a few weeks off and get started How do I know you wouldn't use it on some other woman Why rub it in said Gordon quietly I'm not rubbing it in I hate to see you this way Will you lend me the money Phil I can't decide right off That's a lot of money and it'll be darn inconvenient for me It'll be hell for me if you can't—I know I'm whining and it's all my own fault but—that doesn't change it When could you pay it back This was encouraging Gordon considered It was probably wisest to be frank Of course I could promise to send it back next month but—I'd better say three months Just as soon as I start to sell drawings How do I know you'll sell any drawings A new hardness in Dean's voice sent a faint chill of doubt over Gordon Was it possible that he wouldn't get the money I supposed you had a little confidence in me I did have—but when I see you like this I begin to wonder Do you suppose if I wasn't at the end of my rope I'd come to you like this Do you think I'm enjoying it He broke off and bit his lip feeling that he had better subdue the rising anger in his voice After all he was the suppliant You seem to manage it pretty easily said Dean angrily You put me in the position where if I don't lend it to you I'm a sucker—oh yes you do And let me tell you it's no easy thing for me to get hold of three hundred dollars My income isn't so big but that a slice like that won't play the deuce with it He left his chair and began to dress choosing his clothes carefully Gordon stretched out his arms and clenched the edges of the bed fighting back a desire to cry out His head was splitting and whirring his mouth was dry and bitter and he could feel the fever in his blood resolving itself into innumerable regular counts like a slow dripping from a roof Dean tied his tie precisely brushed his eyebrows and removed a piece of tobacco from his teeth with solemnity Next he filled his cigarette case tossed the empty box thoughtfully into the waste basket and settled the case in his vest pocket Had breakfast he demanded No I don't eat it any more Well we'll go out and have some We'll decide about that money later I'm sick of the subject I came East to have a good time Let's go over to the Yale Club he continued moodily and then added with an implied reproof You've given up your job You've got nothing else to do I'd have a lot to do if I had a little money said Gordon pointedly Oh for Heaven's sake drop the subject for a while No point in glooming on my whole trip Here here's some money He took a fivedollar bill from his wallet and tossed it over to Gordon who folded it carefully and put it in his pocket There was an added spot of color in his cheeks an added glow that was not fever For an instant before they turned to go out their eyes met and in that instant each found something that made him lower his own glance quickly For in that instant they quite suddenly and definitely hated each other II Fifth Avenue and Fortyfourth Street swarmed with the noon crowd The wealthy happy sun glittered in transient gold through the thick windows of the smart shops lighting upon mesh bags and purses and strings of pearls in gray velvet cases upon gaudy feather fans of many colors upon the laces and silks of expensive dresses upon the bad paintings and the fine period furniture in the elaborate show rooms of interior decorators Workinggirls in pairs and groups and swarms loitered by these windows choosing their future boudoirs from some resplendent display which included even a man's silk pajamas laid domestically across the bed They stood in front of the jewelry stores and picked out their engagement rings and their wedding rings and their platinum wrist watches and then drifted on to inspect the feather fans and opera cloaks meanwhile digesting the sandwiches and sundaes they had eaten for lunch All through the crowd were men in uniform sailors from the great fleet anchored in the Hudson soldiers with divisional insignia from Massachusetts to California wanting fearfully to be noticed and finding the great city thoroughly fed up with soldiers unless they were nicely massed into pretty formations and uncomfortable under the weight of a pack and rifle Through this medley Dean and Gordon wandered the former interested made alert by the display of humanity at its frothiest and gaudiest the latter reminded of how often he had been one of the crowd tired casually fed overworked and dissipated To Dean the struggle was significant young cheerful to Gordon it was dismal meaningless endless In the Yale Club they met a group of their former classmates who greeted the visiting Dean vociferously Sitting in a semicircle of lounges and great chairs they had a highball all around Gordon found the conversation tiresome and interminable They lunched together en masse warmed with liquor as the afternoon began They were all going to the Gamma Psi dance that night—it promised to be the best party since the war Edith Bradin's coming said some one to Gordon Didn't she used to be an old flame of yours Aren't you both from Harrisburg Yes He tried to change the subject I see her brother occasionally He's sort of a socialistic nut Runs a paper or something here in New York Not like his gay sister eh continued his eager informant Well she's coming tonight—with a junior named Peter Himmel Gordon was to meet Jewel Hudson at eight o'clock—he had promised to have some money for her Several times he glanced nervously at his wrist watch At four to his relief Dean rose and announced that he was going over to Rivers Brothers to buy some collars and ties But as they left the Club another of the party joined them to Gordon's great dismay Dean was in a jovial mood now happy expectant of the evening's party faintly hilarious Over in Rivers' he chose a dozen neckties selecting each one after long consultations with the other man Did he think narrow ties were coming back And wasn't it a shame that Rivers couldn't get any more Welsh Margotson collars There never was a collar like the Covington Gordon was in something of a panic He wanted the money immediately And he was now inspired also with a vague idea of attending the Gamma Psi dance He wanted to see Edith—Edith whom he hadn't met since one romantic night at the Harrisburg Country Club just before he went to France The affair had died drowned in the turmoil of the war and quite forgotten in the arabesque of these three months but a picture of her poignant debonnaire immersed in her own inconsequential chatter recurred to him unexpectedly and brought a hundred memories with it It was Edith's face that he had cherished through college with a sort of detached yet affectionate admiration He had loved to draw her—around his room had been a dozen sketches of her—playing golf swimming—he could draw her pert arresting profile with his eyes shut They left Rivers' at fivethirty and parsed for a moment on the sidewalk Well said Dean genially I'm all set now Think I'll go back to the hotel and get a shave haircut and massage Good enough said the other man I think I'll join you Gordon wondered if he was to be beaten after all With difficulty he restrained himself from turning to the man and snarling out Go on away damn you In despair he suspected that perhaps Dean had spoken to him was keeping him along in order to avoid a dispute about the money They went into the Biltmore—a Biltmore alive with girls—mostly from the West and South the stellar débutantes of many cities gathered for the dance of a famous fraternity of a famous university But to Gordon they were faces in a dream He gathered together his forces for a last appeal was about to come out with he knew not what when Dean suddenly excused himself to the other man and taking Gordon's arm led him aside Gordy he said quickly I've thought the whole thing over carefully and I've decided that I can't lend you that money I'd like to oblige you but I don't feel I ought to—it'd put a crimp in me for a month Gordon watching him dully wondered why he had never before noticed how much those upper teeth projected I'm—mighty sorry Gordon continued Dean but that's the way it is He took out his wallet and deliberately counted out seventyfive dollars in bills Here he said holding them out here's seventyfive that makes eighty all together That's all the actual cash I have with me besides what I'll actually spend on the trip Gordon raised his clenched hand automatically opened it as though it were a tongs he was holding and clenched it again on the money I'll see you at the dance continued Dean I've got to get along to the barber shop Solong said Gordon in a strained and husky voice Solong Dean began to smile but seemed to change his mind He nodded briskly and disappeared But Gordon stood there his handsome face awry with distress the roll of bills clenched tightly in his hand Then blinded by sudden tears he stumbled clumsily down the Biltmore steps About nine o'clock of the same night two human beings came out of a cheap restaurant in Sixth Avenue They were ugly illnourished devoid of all except the very lowest form of intelligence and without even that animal exuberance that in itself brings color into life they were lately verminridden cold and hungry in a dirty town of a strange land they were poor friendless tossed as driftwood from their births they would be tossed as driftwood to their deaths They were dressed in the uniform of the United States Army and on the shoulder of each was the insignia of a drafted division from New Jersey landed three days before The taller of the two was named Carrol Key a name hinting that in his veins however thinly diluted by generations of degeneration ran blood of some potentiality But one could stare endlessly at the long chinless face the dull watery eyes and high cheekbones without finding suggestion of either ancestral worth or native resourcefulness His companion was swart and bandylegged with rateyes and a muchbroken hooked nose His defiant air was obviously a pretense a weapon of protection borrowed from that world of snarl and snap of physical bluff and physical menace in which he had always lived His name was Gus Rose Leaving the café they sauntered down Sixth Avenue wielding toothpicks with great gusto and complete detachment Where to asked Rose in a tone which implied that he would not be surprised if Key suggested the South Sea Islands What you say we see if we can getta holda some liquor Prohibition was not yet The ginger in the suggestion was caused by the law forbidding the selling of liquor to soldiers Rose agreed enthusiastically I got an idea continued Key after a moment's thought I got a brother somewhere In New York Yeah He's an old fella He meant that he was an elder brother He's a waiter in a hash joint Maybe he can get us some I'll say he can B'lieve me I'm goin' to get this darn uniform off me tomorra Never get me in it again neither I'm goin' to get me some regular clothes Say maybe I'm not As their combined finances were something less than five dollars this intention can be taken largely as a pleasant game of words harmless and consoling It seemed to please both of them however for they reinforced it with chuckling and mention of personages high in biblical circles adding such further emphasis as Oh boy You know and I'll say so repeated many times over The entire mental pabulum of these two men consisted of an offended nasal comment extended through the years upon the institution—army business or poorhouse—which kept them alive and toward their immediate superior in that institution Until that very morning the institution had been the government and the immediate superior had been the Cap'n—from these two they had glided out and were now in the vaguely uncomfortable state before they should adopt their next bondage They were uncertain resentful and somewhat ill at ease This they hid by pretending an elaborate relief at being out of the army and by assuring each other that military discipline should never again rule their stubborn libertyloving wills Yet as a matter of fact they would have felt more at home in a prison than in this newfound and unquestionable freedom Suddenly Key increased his gait Rose looking up and following his glance discovered a crowd that was collecting fifty yards down the street Key chuckled and began to run in the direction of the crowd Rose thereupon also chuckled and his short bandy legs twinkled beside the long awkward strides of his companion Reaching the outskirts of the crowd they immediately became an indistinguishable part of it It was composed of ragged civilians somewhat the worse for liquor and of soldiers representing many divisions and many stages of sobriety all clustered around a gesticulating little Jew with long black whiskers who was waving his arms and delivering an excited but succinct harangue Key and Rose having wedged themselves into the approximate parquet scrutinized him with acute suspicion as his words penetrated their common consciousness — What have you got outa the war he was crying fiercely Look arounja look arounja Are you rich Have you got a lot of money offered you—no you're lucky if you're alive and got both your legs you're lucky if you came back an' find your wife ain't gone off with some other fella that had the money to buy himself out of the war That's when you're lucky Who got anything out of it except J P Morgan an' John D Rockerfeller At this point the little Jew's oration was interrupted by the hostile impact of a fist upon the point of his bearded chin and he toppled backward to a sprawl on the pavement God damn Bolsheviki cried the big soldierblacksmith who had delivered the blow There was a rumble of approval the crowd closed in nearer The Jew staggered to his feet and immediately went down again before a halfdozen reachingin fists This time he stayed down breathing heavily blood oozing from his lip where it was cut within and without There was a riot of voices and in a minute Rose and Key found themselves flowing with the jumbled crowd down Sixth Avenue under the leadership of a thin civilian in a slouch hat and the brawny soldier who had summarily ended the oration The crowd had marvellously swollen to formidable proportions and a stream of more noncommittal citizens followed it along the sidewalks lending their moral support by intermittent huzzas Where we goin' yelled Key to the man nearest him His neighbor pointed up to the leader in the slouch hat That guy knows where there's a lot of 'em We're goin' to show 'em We're goin' to show 'em whispered Key delightedly to Rose who repeated the phrase rapturously to a man on the other side Down Sixth Avenue swept the procession joined here and there by soldiers and marines and now and then by civilians who came up with the inevitable cry that they were just out of the army themselves as if presenting it as a card of admission to a newly formed Sporting and Amusement Club Then the procession swerved down a cross street and headed for Fifth Avenue and the word filtered here and there that they were bound for a Red meeting at Tolliver Hall Where is it The question went up the line and a moment later the answer floated hack Tolliver Hall was down on Tenth Street There was a bunch of other sojers who was goin' to break it up and was down there now But Tenth Street had a faraway sound and at the word a general groan went up and a score of the procession dropped out Among these were Rose and Key who slowed down to a saunter and let the more enthusiastic sweep on by I'd rather get some liquor said Key as they halted and made their way to the sidewalk amid cries of Shell hole and Quitters Does your brother work around here asked Rose assuming the air of one passing from the superficial to the eternal He oughta replied Key I ain't seen him for a coupla years I been out to Pennsylvania since Maybe he don't work at night anyhow It's right along here He can get us some o'right if he ain't gone They found the place after a few minutes' patrol of the street—a shoddy tablecloth restaurant between Fifth Avenue and Broadway Here Key went inside to inquire for his brother George while Rose waited on the sidewalk He ain't here no more said Key emerging He's a waiter up to Delmonico's Rose nodded wisely as if he'd expected as much One should not be surprised at a capable man changing jobs occasionally He knew a waiter once—there ensued a long conversation as they waited as to whether waiters made more in actual wages than in tips—it was decided that it depended on the social tone of the joint wherein the waiter labored After having given each other vivid pictures of millionaires dining at Delmonico's and throwing away fiftydollar bills after their first quart of champagne both men thought privately of becoming waiters In fact Key's narrow brow was secreting a resolution to ask his brother to get him a job A waiter can drink up all the champagne those fellas leave in bottles suggested Rose with some relish and then added as an afterthought Oh boy By the time they reached Delmonico's it was half past ten and they were surprised to see a stream of taxis driving up to the door one after the other and emitting marvelous hatless young ladies each one attended by a stiff young gentleman in evening clothes It's a party said Rose with some awe Maybe we better not go in He'll be busy No he won't He'll be o'right After some hesitation they entered what appeared to them to be the least elaborate door and indecision falling upon them immediately stationed themselves nervously in an inconspicuous corner of the small diningroom in which they found themselves They took off their caps and held them in their hands A cloud of gloom fell upon them and both started when a door at one end of the room crashed open emitting a cometlike waiter who streaked across the floor and vanished through another door on the other side There had been three of these lightning passages before the seekers mustered the acumen to hail a waiter He turned looked at them suspiciously and then approached with soft catlike steps as if prepared at any moment to turn and flee Say began Key say do you know my brother He's a waiter here His name is Key annotated Rose Yes the waiter knew Key He was upstairs he thought There was a big dance going on in the main ballroom He'd tell him Ten minutes later George Key appeared and greeted his brother with the utmost suspicion his first and most natural thought being that he was going to be asked for money George was tall and weak chinned but there his resemblance to his brother ceased The waiter's eyes were not dull they were alert and twinkling and his manner was suave indoor and faintly superior They exchanged formalities George was married and had three children He seemed fairly interested but not impressed by the news that Carrol had been abroad in the army This disappointed Carrol George said the younger brother these amenities having been disposed of we want to get some booze and they won't sell us none Can you get us some George considered Sure Maybe I can It may be half an hour though All right agreed Carrol we'll wait At this Rose started to sit down in a convenient chair but was hailed to his feet by the indignant George Hey Watch out you Can't sit down here This room's all set for a twelve o'clock banquet I ain't goin' to hurt it said Rose resentfully I been through the delouser Never mind said George sternly if the head waiter seen me here talkin' he'd romp all over me Oh The mention of the head waiter was full explanation to the other two they fingered their overseas caps nervously and waited for a suggestion I tell you said George after a pause I got a place you can wait you just come here with me They followed him out the far door through a deserted pantry and up a pair of dark winding stairs emerging finally into a small room chiefly furnished by piles of pails and stacks of scrubbing brushes and illuminated by a single dim electric light There he left them after soliciting two dollars and agreeing to return in half an hour with a quart of whiskey George is makin' money I bet said Key gloomily as he seated himself on an inverted pail I bet he's making fifty dollars a week Rose nodded his head and spat I bet he is too What'd he say the dance was of A lot of college fellas Yale College They both nodded solemnly at each other Wonder where that crowda sojers is now I don't know I know that's too damn long to walk for me Me too You don't catch me walkin' that far Ten minutes later restlessness seized them I'm goin' to see what's out here said Rose stepping cautiously toward the other door It was a swinging door of green baize and he pushed it open a cautious inch See anything For answer Rose drew in his breath sharply Doggone Here's some liquor I'll say Liquor Key joined Rose at the door and looked eagerly I'll tell the world that's liquor he said after a moment of concentrated gazing It was a room about twice as large as the one they were in—and in it was prepared a radiant feast of spirits There were long walls of alternating bottles set along two white covered tables whiskey gin brandy French and Italian vermouths and orange juice not to mention an array of syphons and two great empty punch bowls The room was as yet uninhabited It's for this dance they're just starting whispered Key hear the violins playin' Say boy I wouldn't mind havin' a dance They closed the door softly and exchanged a glance of mutual comprehension There was no need of feeling each other out I'd like to get my hands on a coupla those bottles said Rose emphatically Me too Do you suppose we'd get seen Key considered Maybe we better wait till they start drinkin' 'em They got 'em all laid out now and they know how many of them there are They debated this point for several minutes Rose was all for getting his hands on a bottle now and tucking it under his coat before anyone came into the room Key however advocated caution He was afraid he might get his brother in trouble If they waited till some of the bottles were opened it'd be all right to take one and everybody'd think it was one of the college fellas While they were still engaged in argument George Key hurried through the room and barely grunting at them disappeared by way of the green baize door A minute later they heard several corks pop and then the sound of cracking ice and splashing liquid George was mixing the punch The soldiers exchanged delighted grins Oh boy whispered Rose George reappeared Just keep low boys he said quickly Ill have your stuff for you in five minutes He disappeared through the door by which he had come As soon as his footsteps receded down the stairs Rose after a cautious look darted into the room of delights and reappeared with a bottle in his hand Here's what I say he said as they sat radiantly digesting their first drink We'll wait till he comes up and we'll ask him if we can't just stay here and drink what he brings us—see We'll tell him we haven't got any place to drink it—see Then we can sneak in there whenever there ain't nobody in that there room and tuck a bottle under our coats We'll have enough to last us a coupla days—see Sure agreed Rose enthusiastically Oh boy And if we want to we can sell it to sojers any time we want to They were silent for a moment thinking rosily of this idea Then Key reached up and unhooked the collar of his O D coat It's hot in here ain't it Rose agreed earnestly Hot as hell She was still quite angry when she came out of the dressingroom and crossed the intervening parlor of politeness that opened onto the hall—angry not so much at the actual happening which was after all the merest commonplace of her social existence but because it had occurred on this particular night She had no quarrel with herself She had acted with that correct mixture of dignity and reticent pity which she always employed She had succinctly and deftly snubbed him It had happened when their taxi was leaving the Biltmore—hadn't gone half a block He had lifted his right arm awkwardly—she was on his right side—and attempted to settle it snugly around the crimson furtrimmed opera cloak she wore This in itself had been a mistake It was inevitably more graceful for a young man attempting to embrace a young lady of whose acquiescence he was not certain to first put his far arm around her It avoided that awkward movement of raising the near arm His second faux pas was unconscious She had spent the afternoon at the hairdresser's the idea of any calamity overtaking her hair was extremely repugnant—yet as Peter made his unfortunate attempt the point of his elbow had just faintly brushed it That was his second faux pas Two were quite enough He had begun to murmur At the first murmur she had decided that he was nothing but a college boy—Edith was twentytwo and anyhow this dance first of its kind since the war was reminding her with the accelerating rhythm of its associations of something else—of another dance and another man a man for whom her feelings had been little more than a sadeyed adolescent mooniness Edith Bradin was falling in love with her recollection of Gordon Sterrett So she came out of the dressingroom at Delmonico's and stood for a second in the doorway looking over the shoulders of a black dress in front of her at the groups of Yale men who flitted like dignified black moths around the head of the stairs From the room she had left drifted out the heavy fragrance left by the passage to and fro of many scented young beauties—rich perfumes and the fragile memoryladen dust of fragrant powders This odor drifting out acquired the tang of cigarette smoke in the hall and then settled sensuously down the stairs and permeated the ballroom where the Gamma Psi dance was to be held It was an odor she knew well exciting stimulating restlessly sweet—the odor of a fashionable dance She thought of her own appearance Her bare arms and shoulders were powdered to a creamy white She knew they looked very soft and would gleam like milk against the black backs that were to silhouette them tonight The hairdressing had been a success her reddish mass of hair was piled and crushed and creased to an arrogant marvel of mobile curves Her lips were finely made of deep carmine the irises of her eyes were delicate breakable blue like china eyes She was a complete infinitely delicate quite perfect thing of beauty flowing in an even line from a complex coiffure to two small slim feet She thought of what she would say tonight at this revel faintly prestiged already by the sounds of high and low laughter and slippered footsteps and movements of couples up and down the stairs She would talk the language she had talked for many years—her line—made up of the current expressions bits of journalese and college slang strung together into an intrinsic whole careless faintly provocative delicately sentimental She stalled faintly as she heard a girl sitting on the stairs near her say You don't know the half of it dearie And as she smiled her anger melted for a moment and closing her eyes she drew in a deep breath of pleasure She dropped her arms to her side until they were faintly touching the sleek sheath that covered and suggested her figure She had never felt her own softness so much nor so enjoyed the whiteness of her own arms I smell sweet she said to herself simply and then came another thought I'm made for love She liked the sound of this and thought it again then inevitable succession came her newborn riot of dreams about Gordon The twist of her imagination which two months before had disclosed to her her unguessed desire to see him again seemed now to have been leading up to this dance this hour For all her sleek beauty Edith was a grave slowthinking girl There was a streak in her of that same desire to ponder of that adolescent idealism that had turned her brother socialist and pacifist Henry Bradin had left Cornell where he had been an instructor in economies and had come to New York to pour the latest cures for incurable evils into the columns of a radical weekly newspaper Edith less fatuously would have been content to cure Gordon Sterrett There was a quality of weakness in Gordon that she wanted to take care of there was a helplessness in him that she wanted to protect And she wanted someone she had known a long while someone who had loved her a long while She was a little tired she wanted to get married Out of a pile of letters half a dozen pictures and as many memories and this weariness she had decided that next time she saw Gordon their relations were going to be changed She would say something that would change them There was this evening This was her evening All evenings were her evenings Then her thoughts were interrupted by a solemn undergraduate with a hurt look and an air of strained formality who presented himself before her and bowed unusually low It was the man she had come with Peter Himmel He was tall and humorous with hornedrimmed glasses and an air of attractive whimsicality She suddenly rather disliked him—probably because he had not succeeded in kissing her Well she began are you still furious at me Not at all She stepped forward and took his arm I'm sorry she said softly I don't know why I snapped out that way I'm in a bum humor tonight for some strange reason I'm sorry S'all right he mumbled don't mention it He felt disagreeably embarrassed Was she rubbing in the fact of his late failure It was a mistake she continued on the same consciously gentle key We'll both forget it For this he hated her A few minutes later they drifted out on the floor while the dozen swaying sighing members of the specially hired jazz orchestra informed the crowded ballroom that if a saxophone and me are left alone why then two is companee A man with a mustache cut in Hello he began reprovingly You don't remember me I can't just think of your name she said lightly—and I know you so well I met you up at— His voice trailed disconsolately off as a man with very fair hair cut in Edith murmured a conventional Thanks loads—cut in later to the inconnu The very fair man insisted on shaking hands enthusiastically She placed him as one of the numerous Jims of her acquaintance—last name a mystery She remembered even that he had a peculiar rhythm in dancing and found as they started that she was right Going to be here long he breathed confidentially She leaned back and looked up at him Couple of weeks Where are you Biltmore Call me up some day I mean it he assured her I will We'll go to tea So do I—Do A dark man cut in with intense formality You don't remember me do you he said gravely I should say I do Your name's Harlan Noope Barlow Well I knew there were two syllables anyway You're the boy that played the ukulele so well up at Howard Marshall's house party I played—but not— A man with prominent teeth cut in Edith inhaled a slight cloud of whiskey She liked men to have had something to drink they were so much more cheerful and appreciative and complimentary—much easier to talk to My name's Dean Philip Dean he said cheerfully You don't remember me I know but you used to come up to New Haven with a fellow I roomed with senior year Gordon Sterrett Edith looked up quickly Yes I went up with him twice—to the Pump and Slipper and the Junior prom You've seen him of course said Dean carelessly He's here tonight I saw him just a minute ago Edith started Yet she had felt quite sure he would be here Why no I haven't— A fat man with red hair cut in Hello Edith he began Why—hello there— She slipped stumbled lightly I'm sorry dear she murmured mechanically She had seen Gordon—Gordon very white and listless leaning against the side of a doorway smoking and looking into the ballroom Edith could see that his face was thin and wan—that the hand he raised to his lips with a cigarette was trembling They were dancing quite close to him now —They invite so darn many extra fellas that you— the short man was saying Hello Gordon called Edith over her partner's shoulder Her heart was pounding wildly His large dark eyes were fixed on her He took a step in her direction Her partner turned her away—she heard his voice bleating—— —but half the stags get lit and leave before long so— Then a low tone at her side May I please She was dancing suddenly with Gordon one of his arms was around her she felt it tighten spasmodically felt his hand on her back with the fingers spread Her hand holding the little lace handkerchief was crushed in his Why Gordon she began breathlessly Hello Edith She slipped again—was tossed forward by her recovery until her face touched the black cloth of his dinner coat She loved him—she knew she loved him—then for a minute there was silence while a strange feeling of uneasiness crept over her Something was wrong Of a sudden her heart wrenched and turned over as she realized what it was He was pitiful and wretched a little drunk and miserably tired Oh— she cried involuntarily His eyes looked down at her She saw suddenly that they were bloodstreaked and rolling uncontrollably Gordon she murmured we'll sit down I want to sit down They were nearly in midfloor but she had seen two men start toward her from opposite sides of the room so she halted seized Gordon's limp hand and led him bumping through the crowd her mouth tight shut her face a little pale under her rouge her eyes trembling with tears She found a place high up on the softcarpeted stairs and he sat down heavily beside her Well he began staring at her unsteadily I certainly am glad to see you Edith She looked at him without answering The effect of this on her was immeasurable For years she had seen men in various stages of intoxication from uncles all the way down to chauffeurs and her feelings had varied from amusement to disgust but here for the first time she was seized with a new feeling—an unutterable horror Gordon she said accusingly and almost crying you look like the devil He nodded I've had trouble Edith Trouble All sorts of trouble Don't you say anything to the family but I'm all gone to pieces I'm a mess Edith His lower lip was sagging He seemed scarcely to see her Can't you—can't you she hesitated can't you tell me about it Gordon You know I'm always interested in you She bit her lip—she had intended to say something stronger but found at the end that she couldn't bring it out Gordon shook his head dully I can't tell you You're a good woman I can't tell a good woman the story Rot she said defiantly I think it's a perfect insult to call any one a good woman in that way It's a slam You've been drinking Gordon Thanks He inclined his head gravely Thanks for the information Why do you drink Because I'm so damn miserable Do you think drinking's going to make it any better What you doing—trying to reform me No I'm trying to help you Gordon Can't you tell me about it I'm in an awful mess Best thing you can do is to pretend not to know me Why Gordon I'm sorry I cut in on you—its unfair to you You're pure woman—and all that sort of thing Here I'll get some one else to dance with you He rose clumsily to his feet but she reached up and pulled him down beside her on the stairs Here Gordon You're ridiculous You're hurting me You're acting like a—like a crazy man— I admit it I'm a little crazy Something's wrong with me Edith There's something left me It doesn't matter It does tell me Just that I was always queer—little bit different from other boys All right in college but now it's all wrong Things have been snapping inside me for four months like little hooks on a dress and it's about to come off when a few more hooks go I'm very gradually going loony He turned his eyes full on her and began to laugh and she shrank away from him What is the matter Just me he repeated I'm going loony This whole place is like a dream to me—this Delmonico's— As he talked she saw he had changed utterly He wasn't at all light and gay and careless—a great lethargy and discouragement had come over him Revulsion seized her followed by a faint surprising boredom His voice seemed to come out of a great void Edith he said I used to think I was clever talented an artist Now I know I'm nothing Can't draw Edith Don't know why I'm telling you this She nodded absently I can't draw I can't do anything I'm poor as a church mouse He laughed bitterly and rather too loud I've become a damn beggar a leech on my friends I'm a failure I'm poor as hell Her distaste was growing She barely nodded this time waiting for her first possible cue to rise Suddenly Gordon's eyes filled with tears Edith he said turning to her with what was evidently a strong effort at selfcontrol I can't tell you what it means to me to know there's one person left who's interested in me He reached out and patted her hand and involuntarily she drew it away It's mighty fine of you he repeated Well she said slowly looking him in the eye any one's always glad to see an old friend—but I'm sorry to see you like this Gordon There was a pause while they looked at each other and the momentary eagerness in his eyes wavered She rose and stood looking at him her face quite expressionless Shall we dance she suggested coolly —Love is fragile—she was thinking—but perhaps the pieces are saved the things that hovered on lips that might have been said The new love words the tendernesses learned are treasured up for the next lover Peter Himmel escort to the lovely Edith was unaccustomed to being snubbed having been snubbed he was hurt and embarrassed and ashamed of himself For a matter of two months he had been on special delivery terms with Edith Bradin and knowing that the one excuse and explanation of the special delivery letter is its value in sentimental correspondence he had believed himself quite sure of his ground He searched in vain for any reason why she should have taken this attitude in the matter of a simple kiss Therefore when he was cut in on by the man with the mustache he went out into the hall and making up a sentence said it over to himself several times Considerably deleted this was it Well if any girl ever led a man on and then jolted him she did—and she has no kick coming if I go out and get beautifully boiled So he walked through the supper room into a small room adjoining it which he had located earlier in the evening It was a room in which there were several large bowls of punch flanked by many bottles He took a seat beside the table which held the bottles At the second highball boredom disgust the monotony of time the turbidity of events sank into a vague background before which glittering cobwebs formed Things became reconciled to themselves things lay quietly on their shelves the troubles of the day arranged themselves in trim formation and at his curt wish of dismissal marched off and disappeared And with the departure of worry came brilliant permeating symbolism Edith became a flighty negligible girl not to be worried over rather to be laughed at She fitted like a figure of his own dream into the surface world forming about him He himself became in a measure symbolic a type of the continent bacchanal the brilliant dreamer at play Then the symbolic mood faded and as he sipped his third highball his imagination yielded to the warm glow and he lapsed into a state similar to floating on his back in pleasant water It was at this point that he noticed that a green baize door near him was open about two inches and that through the aperture a pair of eyes were watching him intently Hm murmured Peter calmly The green door closed—and then opened again—a bare half inch this time Peekaboo murmured Peter The door remained stationary and then he became aware of a series of tense intermittent whispers One guy What's he doin' He's sittin' lookin' He better beat it off We gotta get another li'l' bottle Peter listened while the words filtered into his consciousness Now this he thought is most remarkable He was excited He was jubilant He felt that he had stumbled upon a mystery Affecting an elaborate carelessness he arose and waited around the table—then turning quickly pulled open the green door precipitating Private Rose into the room Peter bowed How do you do he said Private Rose set one foot slightly in front of the other poised for fight flight or compromise How do you do repeated Peter politely I'm o'right Can I offer you a drink Private Rose looked at him searchingly suspecting possible sarcasm O'right he said finally Peter indicated a chair Sit down I got a friend said Rose I got a friend in there He pointed to the green door By all means let's have him in Peter crossed over opened the door and welcomed in Private Key very suspicious and uncertain and guilty Chairs were found and the three took their seats around the punch bowl Peter gave them each a highball and offered them a cigarette from his case They accepted both with some diffidence Now continued Peter easily may I ask why you gentlemen prefer to lounge away your leisure hours in a room which is chiefly furnished as far as I can see with scrubbing brushes And when the human race has progressed to the stage where seventeen thousand chairs are manufactured on every day except Sunday— he paused Rose and Key regarded him vacantly Will you tell me went on Peter why you choose to rest yourselves on articles intended for the transportation of water from one place to another At this point Rose contributed a grunt to the conversation And lastly finished Peter will you tell me why when you are in a building beautifully hung with enormous candelabra you prefer to spend these evening hours under one anemic electric light Rose looked at Key Key looked at Rose They laughed they laughed uproariously they found it was impossible to look at each other without laughing But they were not laughing with this man—they were laughing at him To them a man who talked after this fashion was either raving drunk or raving crazy You are Yale men I presume said Peter finishing his highball and preparing another They laughed again Naah So I thought perhaps you might be members of that lowly section of the university known as the Sheffield Scientific School Naah Hm Well that's too bad No doubt you are Harvard men anxious to preserve your incognito in this—this paradise of violet blue as the newspapers say Naah said Key scornfully we was just waitin' for somebody Ah exclaimed Peter rising and filling their glasses very interestin' Had a date with a scrublady eh They both denied this indignantly It's all right Peter reassured them don't apologize A scrublady's as good as any lady in the world Kipling says 'Any lady and Judy O'Grady under the skin' Sure said Key winking broadly at Rose My case for instance continued Peter finishing his glass I got a girl up here that's spoiled Spoildest darn girl I ever saw Refused to kiss me no reason whatsoever Led me on deliberately to think sure I want to kiss you and then plunk Threw me over What's the younger generation comin' to Say tha's hard luck said Key—that's awful hard luck Oh boy said Rose Have another said Peter We got in a sort of fight for a while said Key after a pause but it was too far away A fight—tha's stuff said Peter seating himself unsteadily Fight 'em all I was in the army This was with a Bolshevik fella Tha's stuff exclaimed Peter enthusiastic That's what I say Kill the Bolshevik Exterminate 'em We're Americuns said Rose implying a sturdy defiant patriotism Sure said Peter Greatest race in the world We're all Americans Have another They had another At one o'clock a special orchestra special even in a day of special orchestras arrived at Delmonico's and its members seating themselves arrogantly around the piano took up the burden of providing music for the Gamma Psi Fraternity They were headed by a famous fluteplayer distinguished throughout New York for his feat of standing on his head and shimmying with his shoulders while he played the latest jazz on his flute During his performance the lights were extinguished except for the spotlight on the fluteplayer and another roving beam that threw flickering shadows and changing kaleidoscopic colors over the massed dancers Edith had danced herself into that tired dreamy state habitual only with débutantes a state equivalent to the glow of a noble soul after several long highballs Her mind floated vaguely on the bosom of her music her partners changed with the unreality of phantoms under the colorful shifting dusk and to her present coma it seemed as if days had passed since the dance began She had talked on many fragmentary subjects with many men She had been kissed once and made love to six times Earlier in the evening different undergraduates had danced with her but now like all the more popular girls there she had her own entourage—that is half a dozen gallants had singled her out or were alternating her charms with those of some other chosen beauty they cut in on her in regular inevitable succession Several times she had seen Gordon—he had been sitting a long time on the stairway with his palm to his head his dull eyes fixed at an infinite spark on the floor before him very depressed he looked and quite drunk—but Edith each time had averted her glance hurriedly All that seemed long ago her mind was passive now her senses were lulled to trancelike sleep only her feet danced and her voice talked on in hazy sentimental banter But Edith was not nearly so tired as to be incapable of moral indignation when Peter Himmel cut in on her sublimely and happily drunk She gasped and looked up at him Why Peter I'm a li'l' stewed Edith Why Peter you're a peach you are Don't you think it's a bum way of doing—when you're with me Then she smiled unwillingly for he was looking at her with owlish sentimentality varied with a silly spasmodic smile Darlin' Edith he began earnestly you know I love you don't you You tell it well I love you—and I merely wanted you to kiss me he added sadly His embarrassment his shame were both gone She was a mos' beautiful girl in whole worl' Mos' beautiful eyes like stars above He wanted to 'pologize—firs' for presuming try to kiss her second for drinking—but he'd been so discouraged 'cause he had thought she was mad at him—— The redfat man cut in and looking up at Edith smiled radiantly Did you bring any one she asked No The redfat man was a stag Well would you mind—would it be an awful bother for you to—to take me home tonight this extreme diffidence was a charming affectation on Edith's part—she knew that the redfat man would immediately dissolve into a paroxysm of delight Bother Why good Lord I'd be darn glad to You know I'd be darn glad to Thanks loads You're awfully sweet She glanced at her wristwatch It was halfpast one And as she said halfpast one to herself it floated vaguely into her mind that her brother had told her at luncheon that he worked in the office of his newspaper until after onethirty every evening Edith turned suddenly to her current partner What street is Delmonico's on anyway Street Oh why Fifth Avenue of course I mean what cross street Why—let's see—it's on Fortyfourth Street This verified what she had thought Henry's office must be across the street and just around the corner and it occurred to her immediately that she might slip over for a moment and surprise him float in on him a shimmering marvel in her new crimson opera cloak and cheer him up It was exactly the sort of thing Edith revelled in doing—an unconventional jaunty thing The idea reached out and gripped at her imagination—after an instant's hesitation she had decided My hair is just about to tumble entirely down she said pleasantly to her partner would you mind if I go and fix it Not at all You're a peach A few minutes later wrapped in her crimson opera cloak she flitted down a sidestairs her cheeks glowing with excitement at her little adventure She ran by a couple who stood at the door—a weakchinned waiter and an overrouged young lady in hot dispute—and opening the outer door stepped into the warm May night The overrouged young lady followed her with a brief bitter glance—then turned again to the weakchinned waiter and took up her argument You better go up and tell him I'm here she said defiantly or I'll go up myself No you don't said George sternly The girl smiled sardonically Oh I don't don't I Well let me tell you I know more college fellas and more of 'em know me and are glad to take me out on a party than you ever saw in your whole life Maybe so— Maybe so she interrupted Oh it's all right for any of 'em like that one that just ran out—God knows where she went—it's all right for them that are asked here to come or go as they like—but when I want to see a friend they have some cheap hamslinging bringmeadoughnut waiter to stand here and keep me out See here said the elder Key indignantly I can't lose my job Maybe this fella you're talkin' about doesn't want to see you Oh he wants to see me all right Anyways how could I find him in all that crowd Oh he'll be there she asserted confidently You just ask anybody for Gordon Sterrett and they'll point him out to you They all know each other those fellas She produced a mesh bag and taking out a dollar bill handed it to George Here she said here's a bribe You find him and give him my message You tell him if he isn't here in five minutes I'm coming up George shook his head pessimistically considered the question for a moment wavered violently and then withdrew In less than the allotted time Gordon came downstairs He was drunker than he had been earlier in the evening and in a different way The liquor seemed to have hardened on him like a crust He was heavy and lurching—almost incoherent when he talked 'Lo Jewel he said thickly Came right away Jewel I couldn't get that money Tried my best Money nothing she snapped You haven't been near me for ten days What's the matter He shook his head slowly Been very low Jewel Been sick Why didn't you tell me if you were sick I don't care about the money that bad I didn't start bothering you about it at all until you began neglecting me Again he shook his head Haven't been neglecting you Not at all Haven't You haven't been near me for three weeks unless you been so drunk you didn't know what you were doing Been sick Jewel he repeated turning his eyes upon her wearily You're well enough to come and play with your society friends here all right You told me you'd meet me for dinner and you said you'd have some money for me You didn't even bother to ring me up I couldn't get any money Haven't I just been saying that doesn't matter I wanted to see you Gordon but you seem to prefer your somebody else He denied this bitterly Then get your hat and come along she suggested Gordon hesitated—and she came suddenly close to him and slipped her arms around his neck Come on with me Gordon she said in a half whisper We'll go over to Devineries' and have a drink and then we can go up to my apartment I can't Jewel—— You can she said intensely I'm sick as a dog Well then you oughtn't to stay here and dance With a glance around him in which relief and despair were mingled Gordon hesitated then she suddenly pulled him to her and kissed him with soft pulpy lips All right he said heavily I'll get my hat When Edith came out into the clear blue of the May night she found the Avenue deserted The windows of the big shops were dark over their doors were drawn great iron masks until they were only shadowy tombs of the late day's splendor Glancing down toward Fortysecond Street she saw a commingled blur of lights from the allnight restaurants Over on Sixth Avenue the elevated a flare of fire roared across the street between the glimmering parallels of light at the station and streaked along into the crisp dark But at Fortyfourth Street it was very quiet Pulling her cloak close about her Edith darted across the Avenue She started nervously as a solitary man passed her and said in a hoarse whisper—Where bound kiddo She was reminded of a night in her childhood when she had walked around the block in her pajamas and a dog had howled at her from a mysterybig back yard In a minute she had reached her destination a twostory comparatively old building on Fortyfourth in the upper window of which she thankfully detected a wisp of light It was bright enough outside for her to make out the sign beside the window—the New York Trumpet She stepped inside a dark hall and after a second saw the stairs in the corner Then she was in a long low room furnished with many desks and hung on all sides with file copies of newspapers There were only two occupants They were sitting at different ends of the room each wearing a green eyeshade and writing by a solitary desk light For a moment she stood uncertainly in the doorway and then both men turned around simultaneously and she recognized her brother Why Edith He rose quickly and approached her in surprise removing his eyeshade He was tall lean and dark with black piercing eyes under very thick glasses They were faraway eyes that seemed always fixed just over the head of the person to whom he was talking He put his hands on her arms and kissed her cheek What is it he repeated in some alarm I was at a dance across at Delmonico's Henry she said excitedly and I couldn't resist tearing over to see you I'm glad you did His alertness gave way quickly to a habitual vagueness You oughtn't to be out alone at night though ought you The man at the other end of the room had been looking at them curiously but at Henry's beckoning gesture he approached He was loosely fat with little twinkling eyes and having removed his collar and tie he gave the impression of a MiddleWestern farmer on a Sunday afternoon This is my sister said Henry She dropped in to see me How do you do said the fat man smiling My name's Bartholomew Miss Bradin I know your brother has forgotten it long ago Edith laughed politely Well he continued not exactly gorgeous quarters we have here are they Edith looked around the room They seem very nice she replied Where do you keep the bombs The bombs repeated Bartholomew laughing That's pretty good—the bombs Did you hear her Henry She wants to know where we keep the bombs Say that's pretty good Edith swung herself onto a vacant desk and sat dangling her feet over the edge Her brother took a seat beside her Well he asked absentmindedly how do you like New York this trip Not bad I'll be over at the Biltmore with the Hoyts until Sunday Can't you come to luncheon tomorrow He thought a moment I'm especially busy he objected and I hate women in groups All right she agreed unruffled Let's you and me have luncheon together Very well I'll call for you at twelve Bartholomew was obviously anxious to return to his desk but apparently considered that it would be rude to leave without some parting pleasantry Well—he began awkwardly They both turned to him Well we—we had an exciting time earlier in the evening The two men exchanged glances You should have come earlier continued Bartholomew somewhat encouraged We had a regular vaudeville Did you really A serenade said Henry A lot of soldiers gathered down there in the street and began to yell at the sign Why she demanded Just a crowd said Henry abstractedly All crowds have to howl They didn't have anybody with much initiative in the lead or they'd probably have forced their way in here and smashed things up Yes said Bartholomew turning again to Edith you should have been here He seemed to consider this a sufficient cue for withdrawal for he turned abruptly and went back to his desk Are the soldiers all set against the Socialists demanded Edith of her brother I mean do they attack you violently and all that Henry replaced his eyeshade and yawned The human race has come a long way he said casually but most of us are throwbacks the soldiers don't know what they want or what they hate or what they like They're used to acting in large bodies and they seem to have to make demonstrations So it happens to be against us There've been riots all over the city tonight It's May Day you see Was the disturbance here pretty serious Not a bit he said scornfully About twentyfive of them stopped in the street about nine o'clock and began to bellow at the moon Oh—She changed the subject You're glad to see me Henry Why sure You don't seem to be I am I suppose you think I'm a—a waster Sort of the World's Worst Butterfly Henry laughed Not at all Have a good time while you're young Why Do I seem like the priggish and earnest youth No— she paused—but somehow I began thinking how absolutely different the party I'm on is from—from all your purposes It seems sort of—of incongruous doesn't it—me being at a party like that and you over here working for a thing that'll make that sort of party impossible ever any more if your ideas work I don't think of it that way You're young and you're acting just as you were brought up to act Go ahead—have a good time Her feet which had been idly swinging stopped and her voice dropped a note I wish you'd—you'd come back to Harrisburg and have a good time Do you feel sure that you're on the right track—— You're wearing beautiful stockings he interrupted What on earth are they They're embroidered she replied glancing down Aren't they cunning She raised her skirts and uncovered slim silksheathed calves Or do you disapprove of silk stockings He seemed slightly exasperated bent his dark eyes on her piercingly Are you trying to make me out as criticizing you in any way Edith Not at all—— She paused Bartholomew had uttered a grunt She turned and saw that he had left his desk and was standing at the window What is it demanded Henry People said Bartholomew and then after an instant Whole jam of them They're coming from Sixth Avenue People The fat man pressed his nose to the pane Soldiers by God he said emphatically I had an idea they'd come back Edith jumped to her feet and running over joined Bartholomew at the window There's a lot of them she cried excitedly Come here Henry Henry readjusted his shade but kept his seat Hadn't we better turn out the lights suggested Bartholomew No They'll go away in a minute They're not said Edith peering from the window They're not even thinking of going away There's more of them coming Look—there's a whole crowd turning the corner of Sixth Avenue By the yellow glow and blue shadows of the street lamp she could see that the sidewalk was crowded with men They were mostly in uniform some sober some enthusiastically drunk and over the whole swept an incoherent clamor and shouting Henry rose and going to the window exposed himself as a long silhouette against the office lights Immediately the shouting became a steady yell and a rattling fusillade of small missiles corners of tobacco plugs cigaretteboxes and even pennies beat against the window The sounds of the racket now began floating up the stairs as the folding doors revolved They're coming up cried Bartholomew Edith turned anxiously to Henry They're coming up Henry From downstairs in the lower hall their cries were now quite audible —God Damn Socialists ProGermans Bochelovers Second floor front Come on We'll get the sons— The next five minutes passed in a dream Edith was conscious that the clamor burst suddenly upon the three of them like a cloud of rain that there was a thunder of many feet on the stairs that Henry had seized her arm and drawn her back toward the rear of the office Then the door opened and an overflow of men were forced into the room—not the leaders but simply those who happened to be in front Hello Bo Up late ain't you You an' your girl Damn you She noticed that two very drunken soldiers had been forced to the front where they wobbled fatuously—one of them was short and dark the other was tall and weak of chin Henry stepped forward and raised his hand Friends he said The clamor faded into a momentary stillness punctuated with mutterings Friends he repeated his faraway eyes fixed over the heads of the crowd you're injuring no one but yourselves by breaking in here tonight Do we look like rich men Do we look like Germans I ask you in all fairness— Pipe down I'll say you do Say who's your lady friend buddy A man in civilian clothes who had been pawing over a table suddenly held up a newspaper Here it is he shouted They wanted the Germans to win the war A new overflow from the stairs was shouldered in and of a sudden the room was full of men all closing around the pale little group at the back Edith saw that the tall soldier with the weak chin was still in front The short dark one had disappeared She edged slightly backward stood close to the open window through which came a clear breath of cool night air Then the room was a riot She realized that the soldiers were surging forward glimpsed the fat man swinging a chair over his head—instantly the lights went out and she felt the push of warm bodies under rough cloth and her ears were full of shouting and trampling and hard breathing A figure flashed by her out of nowhere tottered was edged sideways and of a sudden disappeared helplessly out through the open window with a frightened fragmentary cry that died staccato on the bosom of the clamor By the faint light streaming from the building backing on the area Edith had a quick impression that it had been the tall soldier with tie weak chin Anger rose astonishingly in her She swung her arms wildly edged blindly toward the thickest of the scuffling She heard grunts curses the muffled impact of fists Henry she called frantically Henry Then it was minutes later she felt suddenly that there were other figures in the room She heard a voice deep bullying authoritative she saw yellow rays of light sweeping here and there in the fracas The cries became more scattered The scuffling increased and then stopped Suddenly the lights were on and the room was full of policemen clubbing left and right The deep voice boomed out Here now Here now Here now And then Quiet down and get out Here now The room seemed to empty like a washbowl A policeman fastgrappled in the corner released his hold on his soldier antagonist and started him with a shove toward the door The deep voice continued Edith perceived now that it came from a bullnecked police captain standing near the door Here now This is no way One of your own sojers got shoved out of the back window an' killed hisself Henry called Edith Henry She beat wildly with her fists on the back of the man in front of her she brushed between two others fought shrieked and beat her way to a very pale figure sitting on the floor close to a desk Henry she cried passionately what's the matter What's the matter Did they hurt you His eyes were shut He groaned and then looking up said disgustedly— They broke my leg My God the fools Here now called the police captain Here now Here now Mr In and Mr Out are not listed by the censustaker You will search for them in vain through the social register or the births marriages and deaths or the grocer's credit list Oblivion has swallowed them and the testimony that they ever existed at all is vague and shadowy and inadmissible in a court of law Yet I have it upon the best authority that for a brief space Mr In and Mr Out lived breathed answered to their names and radiated vivid personalities of their own During the brief span of their lives they walked in their native garments down the great highway of a great nation were laughed at sworn at chased and fled from Then they passed and were heard of no more They were already taking form dimly when a taxi cab with the top open breezed down Broadway in the faintest glimmer of May dawn In this car sat the souls of Mr In and Mr Out discussing with amazement the blue light that had so precipitately colored the sky behind the statue of Christopher Columbus discussing with bewilderment the old gray faces of the early risers which skimmed palely along the street like blown bits of paper on a gray lake They were agreed on all things from the absurdity of the bouncer in Childs' to the absurdity of the business of life They were dizzy with the extreme maudlin happiness that the morning had awakened in their glowing souls Indeed so fresh and vigorous was their pleasure in living that they felt it should be expressed by loud cries Yeowow hooted Peter making a megaphone with his hands—and Dean joined in with a call that though equally significant and symbolic derived its resonance from its very inarticulateness Yoho Yea Yoho Yobuba Fiftythird Street was a bus with a dark bobbedhair beauty atop Fiftysecond was a street cleaner who dodged escaped and sent up a yell of Look where you're aimin' in a pained and grieved voice At Fiftieth Street a group of men on a very white sidewalk in front of a very white building turned to stare after them and shouted Some party boys At Fortyninth Street Peter turned to Dean Beautiful morning he said gravely squinting up his owlish eyes Probably is Go get some breakfast hey Dean agreed—with additions Breakfast and liquor Breakfast and liquor repeated Peter and they looked at each other nodding That's logical Then they both burst into loud laughter Breakfast and liquor Oh gosh No such thing announced Peter Don't serve it Ne'mind We force 'em serve it Bring pressure bear Bring logic bear The taxi cut suddenly off Broadway sailed along a cross street and stopped in front of a heavy tomblike building in Fifth Avenue What's idea The taxidriver informed them that this was Delmonico's This was somewhat puzzling They were forced to devote several minutes to intense concentration for if such an order had been given there must have been a reason for it Somep'm 'bouta coat suggested the taximan That was it Peter's overcoat and hat He had left them at Delmonico's Having decided this they disembarked from the taxi and strolled toward the entrance arm in arm Hey said the taxidriver Huh You better pay me They shook their heads in shocked negation Later not now—we give orders you wait The taxidriver objected he wanted his money now With the scornful condescension of men exercising tremendous selfcontrol they paid him Inside Peter groped in vain through a dim deserted checkroom in search of his coat and derby Gone I guess Somebody stole it Some Sheff student All probability Never mind said Dean nobly I'll leave mine here too—then we'll both be dressed the same He removed his overcoat and hat and was hanging them up when his roving glance was caught and held magnetically by two large squares of cardboard tacked to the two coatroom doors The one on the lefthand door bore the word In in big black letters and the one on the righthand door flaunted the equally emphatic word Out Look he exclaimed happily— Peter's eyes followed his pointing finger What Look at the signs Let's take 'em Good idea Probably pair very rare an' valuable signs Probably come in handy Peter removed the lefthand sign from the door and endeavored to conceal it about his person The sign being of considerable proportions this was a matter of some difficulty An idea flung itself at him and with an air of dignified mystery he turned his back After an instant he wheeled dramatically around and stretching out his arms displayed himself to the admiring Dean He had inserted the sign in his vest completely covering his shirt front In effect the word In had been painted upon his shirt in large black letters Yoho cheered Dean Mister In He inserted his own sign in like manner Mister Out he announced triumphantly Mr In meet Mr Out They advanced and shook hands Again laughter overcame them and they rocked in a shaken spasm of mirth Yoho We probably get a flock of breakfast We'll go—go to the Commodore Arm in arm they sallied out the door and turning east in Fortyfourth Street set out for the Commodore As they came out a short dark soldier very pale and tired who had been wandering listlessly along the sidewalk turned to look at them He started over as though to address them but as they immediately bent on him glances of withering unrecognition he waited until they had started unsteadily down the street and then followed at about forty paces chuckling to himself and saying Oh boy over and over under his breath in delighted anticipatory tones Mr In and Mr Out were meanwhile exchanging pleasantries concerning their future plans We want liquor we want breakfast Neither without the other One and indivisible We want both 'em Both 'em It was quite light now and passersby began to bend curious eyes on the pair Obviously they were engaged in a discussion which afforded each of them intense amusement for occasionally a fit of laughter would seize upon them so violently that still with their arms interlocked they would bend nearly double Reaching the Commodore they exchanged a few spicy epigrams with the sleepyeyed doorman navigated the revolving door with some difficulty and then made their way through a thinly populated but startled lobby to the diningroom where a puzzled waiter showed them an obscure table in a corner They studied the bill of fare helplessly telling over the items to each other in puzzled mumbles Don't see any liquor here said Peter reproachfully The waiter became audible but unintelligible Repeat continued Peter with patient tolerance that there seems to be unexplained and quite distasteful lack of liquor upon bill of fare Here said Dean confidently let me handle him He turned to the waiter—Bring us—bring us— he scanned the bill of fare anxiously Bring us a quart of champagne and a—a—probably ham sandwich The waiter looked doubtful Bring it roared Mr In and Mr Out in chorus The waiter coughed and disappeared There was a short wait during which they were subjected without their knowledge to a careful scrutiny by the headwaiter Then the champagne arrived and at the sight of it Mr In and Mr Out became jubilant Imagine their objecting to us having champagne for breakfast—jus' imagine They both concentrated upon the vision of such an awesome possibility but the feat was too much for them It was impossible for their joint imaginations to conjure up a world where any one might object any one else having champagne for breakfast The waiter drew the cork with an enormous pop and their glasses immediately foamed with pale yellow froth Here's health Mr In Here's same to you Mr Out The waiter withdrew the minutes passed the champagne became low in the bottle It's—it's mortifying said Dean suddenly Wha's mortifying The idea their objecting us having champagne breakfast Mortifying Peter considered Yes tha's word—mortifying Again they collapsed into laughter howled swayed rocked back and forth in their chairs repeating the word mortifying over and over to each other—each repetition seeming to make it only more brilliantly absurd After a few more gorgeous minutes they decided on another quart Their anxious waiter consulted his immediate superior and this discreet person gave implicit instructions that no more champagne should be served Their check was brought Five minutes later arm in arm they left the Commodore and made their way through a curious staring crowd along Fortysecond Street and up Vanderbilt Avenue to the Biltmore There with sudden cunning they rose to the occasion and traversed the lobby walking fast and standing unnaturally erect Once in the diningroom they repeated their performance They were torn between intermittent convulsive laughter and sudden spasmodic discussions of politics college and the sunny state of their dispositions Their watches told them that it was now nine o'clock and a dim idea was born in them that they were on a memorable party something that they would remember always They lingered over the second bottle Either of them had only to mention the word mortifying to send them both into riotous gasps The diningroom was whirring and shifting now a curious lightness permeated and rarefied the heavy air They paid their check and walked out into the lobby It was at this moment that the exterior doors revolved for the thousandth time that morning and admitted into the lobby a very pale young beauty with dark circles under her eyes attired in a muchrumpled evening dress She was accompanied by a plain stout man obviously not an appropriate escort At the top of the stairs this couple encountered Mr In and Mr Out Edith began Mr In stepping toward her hilariously and making a sweeping bow darling good morning The stout man glanced questioningly at Edith as if merely asking her permission to throw this man summarily out of the way 'Scuse familiarity added Peter as an afterthought Edith goodmorning He seized Dean's elbow and impelled him into the foreground Meet Mr In Edith my bes' frien' Inseparable Mr In and Mr Out Mr Out advanced and bowed in fact he advanced so far and bowed so low that he tipped slightly forward and only kept his balance by placing a hand lightly on Edith's shoulder I'm Mr Out Edith he mumbled pleasantly S'misterin Misterout 'Smisterinanout said Peter proudly But Edith stared straight by them her eyes fixed on some infinite speck in the gallery above her She nodded slightly to the stout man who advanced bulllike and with a sturdy brisk gesture pushed Mr In and Mr Out to either side Through this alley he and Edith walked But ten paces farther on Edith stopped again—stopped and pointed to a short dark soldier who was eying the crowd in general and the tableau of Mr In and Mr Out in particular with a sort of puzzled spellbound awe There cried Edith See there Her voice rose became somewhat shrill Her pointing finger shook slightly There's the soldier who broke my brother's leg There were a dozen exclamations a man in a cutaway coat left his place near the desk and advanced alertly the stout person made a sort of lightninglike spring toward the short dark soldier and then the lobby closed around the little group and blotted them from the sight of Mr In and Mr Out But to Mr In and Mr Out this event was merely a particolored iridescent segment of a whirring spinning world They heard loud voices they saw the stout man spring the picture suddenly blurred Then they were in an elevator bound skyward What floor please said the elevator man Any floor said Mr In Top floor said Mr Out This is the top floor said the elevator man Have another floor put on said Mr Out Higher said Mr In Heaven said Mr Out XI In a bedroom of a small hotel just off Sixth Avenue Gordon Sterrett awoke with a pain in the back of his head and a sick throbbing in all his veins He looked at the dusky gray shadows in the corners of the room and at a raw place on a large leather chair in the corner where it had long been in use He saw clothes dishevelled rumpled clothes on the floor and he smelt stale cigarette smoke and stale liquor The windows were tight shut Outside the bright sunlight had thrown a dustfilled beam across the sill—a beam broken by the head of the wide wooden bed in which he had slept He lay very quiet—comatose drugged his eyes wide his mind clicking wildly like an unoiled machine It must have been thirty seconds after he perceived the sunbeam with the dust on it and the rip on the large leather chair that he had the sense of life close beside him and it was another thirty seconds after that before that he realized that he was irrevocably married to Jewel Hudson He went out half an hour later and bought a revolver at a sporting goods store Then he took a took a taxi to the room where he had been living on East Twentyseventh Street and leaning across the table that held his drawing materials fired a cartridge into his head just behind the temple And do you write for any other magazines inquired the young lady Oh yes I assured her I've had some stories and plays in the 'Smart Set' for instance—— The young lady shivered The 'Smart Set' she exclaimed How can you Why they publish stuff about girls in blue bathtubs and silly things like that And I had the magnificent joy of telling her that she was referring to Porcelain and Pink which had appeared there several months before PORCELAIN AND PINK A room in the downstairs of a summer cottage High around the wall runs an art frieze of a fisherman with a pile of nets at his feet and a ship on a crimson ocean a fisherman with a pile of nets at his feet and a ship on a crimson ocean a fisherman with a pile of nets at his feet and so on In one place on the frieze there is an overlapping—here we have half a fisherman with half a pile of nets at his foot crowded damply against half a ship on half a crimson ocean The frieze is not in the plot but frankly it fascinates me I could continue indefinitely but I am distracted by one of the two objects in the room—a blue porcelain bathtub It has character this bathtub It is not one of the new racing bodies but is small with a high tonneau and looks as if it were going to jump discouraged however by the shortness of its legs it has submitted to its environment and to its coat of skyblue paint But it grumpily refuses to allow any patron completely to stretch his legs—which brings us neatly to the second object in the room It is a girl—clearly an appendage to the bathtub only her head and throat—beautiful girls have throats instead of necks—and a suggestion of shoulder appearing above the side For the first ten minutes of the play the audience is engrossed in wondering if she really is playing the game fairly and hasn't any clothes on or whether it is being cheated and she is dressed The girl's name is Julie Marvis From the proud way she sits up in the bathtub we deduce that she is not very tall and that she carries herself well When she smiles her upper tip rolls a little and reminds you of an Easter Bunny She is within whispering distance of twenty years old One thing more—above and to the right of the bathtub is a window It is narrow and has a wide sill it lets in much sunshine but effectually prevents any one who looks in from seeing the bathtub You begin to suspect the plot We open conventionally enough with a song but as the startled gasp of the audience quite drowns out the first half we will give only the last of it Julie In an airy sophranoenthusiastico When Caesar did the Chicago He was a graceful child Those sacred chickens Just raised the dickens The Vestal Virgins went wild Whenever the Nervii got nervy He gave them an awful razz They shook is their shoes With the Consular blues The Imperial Roman Jazz During the wild applause that follows Julie modestly moves her arms and makes waves on the surface of the water—at least we suppose she does Then the door on the left opens and Lois Marvis enters dressed but carrying garments and towels Lois is a year older than Julie and is nearly her double in face and voice but in her clothes and expression are the marks of the conservative Yes you've guessed it Mistaken identity is the old rusty pivot upon which the plot turns Lois Starting Oh 'scuse me I didn't know you were here Julie Oh hello I'm giving a little concert—— Lois Interrupting Why didn't you lock the door Julie Didn't I Lois Of course you didn't Do you think I just walked through it Julie I thought you picked the lock dearest Lois You're so careless Julie No I'm happy as a garbageman's dog and I'm giving a little concert Lois Severely Grow up Julie Waving a pink arm around the room The walls reflect the sound you see That's why there's something very beautiful about singing in a bathtub It gives an effect of surpassing loveliness Can I render you a selection Lois I wish you'd hurry out of the tub Julie Shaking her head thoughtfully Can't be hurried This is my kingdom at present Godliness Lois Why the mellow name Julie Because you're next to Cleanliness Don't throw anything please Lois How long will you be Julie After some consideration Not less than fifteen nor more than twentyfive minutes Lois As a favor to me will you make it ten Julie Reminiscing Oh Godliness do you remember a day in the chill of last January when one Julie famous for her Easterrabbit smile was going out and there was scarcely any hot water and young Julie had just filled the tub for her own little self when the wicked sister came and did bathe herself therein forcing the young Julie to perform her ablutions with cold cream—which is expensive and a darn lot of trouble Lois Impatiently Then you won't hurry Julie Why should I Lois I've got a date Julie Here at the house Lois None of your business Julie shrugs the visible tips of her shoulders and stirs the water into ripples Julie So be it Lois Oh for Heaven's sake yes I have a date here at the house—in a way Julie In a way Lois He isn't coming in He's calling for me and we're walking Julie Raising her eyebrows Oh the plot clears It's that literary Mr Calkins I thought you promised mother you wouldn't invite him in Lois Desperately She's so idiotic She detests him because he's just got a divorce Of course she's had more expedience than I have but—— Julie Wisely Don't let her kid you Experience is the biggest gold brick in the world All older people have it for sale Lois I like him We talk literature Julie Oh so that's why I've noticed all these weighty books around the house lately Lois He lends them to me Julie Well you've got to play his game When in Rome do as the Romans would like to do But I'm through with books I'm all educated Lois You're very inconsistent—last summer you read every day Julie If I were consistent I'd still be living on warm milk out of a bottle Lois Yes and probably my bottle But I like Mr Calkins Julie I never met him Lois Well will you hurry up Julie Yes After a pause I wait till the water gets tepid and then I let in more hot Lois Sarcastically How interesting Julie 'Member when we used to play soapo Lois Yes—and ten years old I'm really quite surprised that you don't play it still Julie I do I'm going to in a minute Lois Silly game Julie Warmly No it isn't It's good for the nerves I'll bet you've forgotten how to play it Lois Defiantly No I haven't You—you get the tub all full of soapsuds and then you get up on the edge and slide down Julie Shaking her head scornfully Huh That's only part of it You've got to slide down without touching your hand or feet—— LoisImpatiently Oh Lord What do I care I wish we'd either stop coming here in the summer or else get a house with two bathtubs Julie You can buy yourself a little tin one or use the hose—— Lois Oh shut up Julie Irrelevantly Leave the towel Lois What Julie Leave the towel when you go Lois This towel Julie Sweetly Yes I forgot my towel Lois Looking around for the first time Why you idiot You haven't even a kimono Julie Also looking around Why so I haven't Lois Suspicion growing on her How did you get here Julie Laughing I guess I—I guess I whisked here You know—a white form whisking down the stairs and—— Lois Scandalized Why you little wretch Haven't you any pride or selfrespect Julie Lots of both I think that proves it I looked very well I really am rather cute in my natural state Lois Well you—— Julie Thinking aloud I wish people didn't wear any clothes I guess I ought to have been a pagan or a native or something Lois You're a—— Julie I dreamt last night that one Sunday in church a small boy brought in a magnet that attracted cloth He attracted the clothes right off of everybody put them in an awful state people were crying and shrieking and carrying on as if they'd just discovered their skins for the first time Only I didn't care So I just laughed I had to pass the collection plate because nobody else would Lois Who has turned a deaf ear to this speech Do you mean to tell me that if I hadn't come you'd have run back to your room—un—unclothed Julie Au naturel is so much nicer Lois Suppose there had been some one in the livingroom Julie There never has been yet Lois Yet Good grief How long—— Julie Besides I usually have a towel Lois Completely overcome Golly You ought to be spanked I hope you get caught I hope there's a dozen ministers in the livingroom when you come out—and their wives and their daughters Julie There wouldn't be room for them in the livingroom answered Clean Kate of the Laundry District Lois All right You've made your own—bathtub you can lie in it Lois starts determinedly for the door Julie In alarm Hey Hey I don't care about the k'mono but I want the towel I can't dry myself on a piece of soap and a wet washrag Lois Obstinately I won't humor such a creature You'll have to dry yourself the best way you can You can roll on the floor like the animals do that don't wear any clothes Julie Complacent again All right Get out Lois Haughtily Huh Julie turns on the cold water and with her finger directs a parabolic stream at Lois Lois retires quickly slamming the door after her Julie laughs and turns off the water Julie Singing When the Arrowcollar man Meets the D'jerkiss girl On the smokeless Sante Fé Her Pebeco smile Her Lucile style De dum dadedum one day— She changes to a whistle and leans forward to turn on the taps but is startled by three loud banging noises in the pipes Silence for a moment—then she puts her mouth down near the spigot as if it were a telephone Julie Hello No answer Are you a plumber No answer Are you the water department One loud hollow bang What do you want No answer I believe you're a ghost Are you No answer Well then stop banging She reaches out and turns on the warm tap No water flows Again she puts her mouth down close to the spigot If you're the plumber that's a mean trick Turn it on for a fellow Two loud hollow bangs Don't argue I want water—water Water A young man's head appears in the window—a head decorated with a slim mustache and sympathetic eyes These last stare and though they can see nothing but many fishermen with nets and much crimson ocean they decide him to speak The Young Man Some one fainted Julie Starting up all ears immediately Jumping cats The Young Man Helpfully Water's no good for fits Julie Fits Who said anything about fits The Young Man You said something about a cat jumping Julie Decidedly I did not The Young Man Well we can talk it over later Are you ready to go out Or do you still feel that if you go with me just now everybody will gossip Julie Smiling Gossip Would they It'd be more than gossip—it'd be a regular scandal The Young Man Here you're going it a little strong Your family might be somewhat disgruntled—but to the pure all things are suggestive No one else would even give it a thought except a few old women Come on Julie You don't know what you ask The Young Man Do you imagine we'd have a crowd following us Julie A crowd There'd be a special allsteel buffet train leaving New York hourly The Young Man Say are you housecleaning Julie Why The Young Man I see all the pictures are off the walls Julie Why we never have pictures in this room The Young Man Odd I never heard of a room without pictures or tapestry or panelling or something Julie There's not even any furniture in here The Young Man What a strange house Julie It depend on the angle you see it from The Young Man Sentimentally It's so nice talking to you like this—when you're merely a voice I'm rather glad I can't see you Julie Gratefully So am I The Young Man What color are you wearing Julie After a critical survey of her shoulders Why I guess it's a sort of pinkish white The Young Man Is it becoming to you Julie Very It's—it's old I've had it for a long while The Young Man I thought you hated old clothes Julie I do but this was a birthday present and I sort of have to wear it The Young Man Pinkishwhite Well I'll bet it's divine Is it in style Julie Quite It's very simple standard model The Young Man What a voice you have How it echoes Sometimes I shut my eyes and seem to see you in a far desert island calling for me And I plunge toward you through the surf hearing you call as you stand there water stretching on both sides of you— The soap slips from the side of the tub and splashes in The young man blinks The Young Man What was that Did I dream it Julie Yes You're—you're very poetic aren't you The Young Man Dreamily No I do prose I do verse only when I am stirred Julie Murmuring Stirred by a spoon—— The Young Man I have always loved poetry I can remember to this day the first poem I ever learned by heart It was Evangeline Julie That's a fib The Young Man Did I say Evangeline I meant The Skeleton in Armor Julie I'm a lowbrow But I can remember my first poem It had one verse Parker and Davis Sittin' on a fence Tryne to make a dollar Outa fifteen cents The Young Man Eagerly Are you growing fond of literature Julie If it's not too ancient or complicated or depressing Same way with people I usually like 'em not too ancient or complicated or depressing The Young Man Of course I've read enormously You told me last night that you were very fond of Walter Scott Julie Considering Scott Let's see Yes I've read Ivanhoe and The Last of the Mohicans The Young Man That's by Cooper Julie Angrily Ivanhoe is You're crazy I guess I know I read it The Young Man The Last of the Mohicans is by Cooper Julie What do I care I like O Henry I don't see how he ever wrote those stories Most of

half sigh ripples from the audience A Belasco midnight comes guickly down and blots out the stage Curtain As long ago as 1860 it was the proper thing to be born at home At present so I am told the high gods of medicine have decreed that the first cries of the young shall be uttered upon the anesthetic air of a hospital preferably a fashionable one So young Mr and Mrs Roger Button were fifty years ahead of style when they decided one day in the summer of 1860 that their first baby should be born in a hospital Whether this anachronism had any bearing upon the astonishing history I am about to set down will never be known I shall tell you what occurred and let you judge for yourself The Roger Buttons held an enviable position both social and financial in antebellum Baltimore They were related to the This Family and the That Family which as every Southerner knew entitled them to membership in that enormous peerage which largely populated the Confederacy This was their first experience with the charming old custom of having babies—Mr Button was naturally nervous He hoped it would be a boy so that he could be sent to Yale College in Connecticut at which institution Mr Button himself had been known for four years by the somewhat obvious nickname of Cuff On the September morning consecrated to the enormous event he arose nervously at six o'clock dressed himself adjusted an impeccable stock and hurried forth through the streets of Baltimore to the hospital to determine whether the darkness of the night had borne in new life upon its bosom When he was approximately a hundred yards from the Maryland Private Hospital for Ladies and Gentlemen he saw Doctor Keene the family physician descending the front steps rubbing his hands together with a washing movement—as all doctors are required to do by the unwritten ethics of their profession Mr Roger Button the president of Roger Button Co Wholesale Hardware began to run toward Doctor Keene with much less dignity than was expected from a Southern gentleman of that picturesque period Doctor Keene he called Oh Doctor Keene The doctor heard him faced around and stood waiting a curious expression settling on his harsh medicinal face as Mr Button drew near What happened demanded Mr Button as he came up in a gasping rush What was it How is she A boy Who is it What—— Talk sense said Doctor Keene sharply He appeared somewhat irritated Is the child born begged Mr Button Doctor Keene frowned Why yes I suppose so—after a fashion Again he threw a curious glance at Mr Button Is my wife all right Yes Is it a boy or a girl Here now cried Doctor Keene in a perfect passion of irritation I'll ask you to go and see for yourself Outrageous He snapped the last word out in almost one syllable then he turned away muttering Do you imagine a case like this will help my professional reputation One more would ruin me—ruin anybody What's the matter demanded Mr Button appalled Triplets No not triplets answered the doctor cuttingly What's more you can go and see for yourself And get another doctor I brought you into the world young man and I've been physician to your family for forty years but I'm through with you I don't want to see you or any of your relatives ever again Goodby Then he turned sharply and without another word climbed into his phaeton which was waiting at the curbstone and drove severely away Mr Button stood there upon the sidewalk stupefied and trembling from head to foot What horrible mishap had occurred He had suddenly lost all desire to go into the Maryland Private Hospital for Ladies and Gentlemen—it was with the greatest difficulty that a moment later he forced himself to mount the steps and enter the front door A nurse was sitting behind a desk in the opaque gloom of the hall Swallowing his shame Mr Button approached her Goodmorning she remarked looking up at him pleasantly Goodmorning I—I am Mr Button At this a look of utter terror spread itself over the girl's face She rose to her feet and seemed about to fly from the hall restraining herself only with the most apparent difficulty I want to see my child said Mr Button The nurse gave a little scream Oh—of course she cried hysterically Upstairs Right upstairs Go—up She pointed the direction and Mr Button bathed in a cool perspiration turned falteringly and began to mount to the second floor In the upper hall he addressed another nurse who approached him basin in hand I'm Mr Button he managed to articulate I want to see my—— Clank The basin clattered to the floor and rolled in the direction of the stairs Clank Clank It began a methodical descent as if sharing in the general terror which this gentleman provoked I want to see my child Mr Button almost shrieked He was on the verge of collapse Clank The basin had reached the first floor The nurse regained control of herself and threw Mr Button a look of hearty contempt All right Mr Button she agreed in a hushed voice Very well But if you knew what a state it's put us all in this morning It's perfectly outrageous The hospital will never have the ghost of a reputation after—— Hurry he cried hoarsely I can't stand this Come this way then Mr Button He dragged himself after her At the end of a long hall they reached a room from which proceeded a variety of howls—indeed a room which in later parlance would have been known as the cryingroom They entered Ranged around the walls were half a dozen whiteenameled rolling cribs each with a tag tied at the head Well gasped Mr Button which is mine There said the nurse Mr Button's eyes followed her pointing finger and this is what he saw Wrapped in a voluminous white blanket and partly crammed into one of the cribs there sat an old man apparently about seventy years of age His sparse hair was almost white and from his chin dripped a long smokecoloured beard which waved absurdly back and forth fanned by the breeze coming in at the window He looked up at Mr Button with dim faded eyes in which lurked a puzzled question Am I mad thundered Mr Button his terror resolving into rage Is this some ghastly hospital joke It doesn't seem like a joke to us replied the nurse severely And I don't know whether you're mad or not—but that is most certainly your child The cool perspiration redoubled on Mr Button's forehead He closed his eyes and then opening them looked again There was no mistake—he was gazing at a man of threescore and ten—a baby of threescore and ten a baby whose feet hung over the sides of the crib in which it was reposing The old man looked placidly from one to the other for a moment and then suddenly spoke in a cracked and ancient voice Are you my father he demanded Mr Button and the nurse started violently Because if you are went on the old man querulously I wish you'd get me out of this place—or at least get them to put a comfortable rocker in here Where in God's name did you come from Who are you burst out Mr Button frantically I can't tell you exactly who I am replied the querulous whine because I've only been born a few hours—but my last name is certainly Button You lie You're an impostor The old man turned wearily to the nurse Nice way to welcome a newborn child he complained in a weak voice Tell him he's wrong why don't you You're wrong Mr Button said the nurse severely This is your child and you'll have to make the best of it We're going to ask you to take him home with you as soon as possible—some time today Home repeated Mr Button incredulously Yes we can't have him here We really can't you know I'm right glad of it whined the old man This is a fine place to keep a youngster of quiet tastes With all this yelling and howling I haven't been able to get a wink of sleep I asked for something to eat—here his voice rose to a shrill note of protest—and they brought me a bottle of milk Mr Button sank down upon a chair near his son and concealed his face in his hands My heavens he murmured in an ecstasy of horror What will people say What must I do You'll have to take him home insisted the nurse—immediately A grotesque picture formed itself with dreadful clarity before the eyes of the tortured man—a picture of himself walking through the crowded streets of the city with this appalling apparition stalking by his side I can't I can't he moaned People would stop to speak to him and what was he going to say He would have to introduce this—this septuagenarian This is my son born early this morning And then the old man would gather his blanket around him and they would plod on past the bustling stores the slave market—for a dark instant Mr Button wished passionately that his son was black—past the luxurious houses of the residential district past the home for the aged Come Pull yourself together commanded the nurse See here the old man announced suddenly if you think I'm going to walk home in this blanket you're entirely mistaken Babies always have blankets With a malicious crackle the old man held up a small white swaddling garment Look he quavered This is what they had ready for me Babies always wear those said the nurse primly Well said the old man this baby's not going to wear anything in about two minutes This blanket itches They might at least have given me a sheet Keep it on Keep it on said Mr Button hurriedly He turned to the nurse What'll I do Go down town and buy your son some clothes Mr Button's son's voice followed him down into the hall And a cane father I want to have a cane Mr Button banged the outer door savagely Goodmorning Mr Button said nervously to the clerk in the Chesapeake Dry Goods Company I want to buy some clothes for my child How old is your child sir About six hours answered Mr Button without due consideration Babies' supply department in the rear Why I don't think—I'm not sure that's what I want It's—he's an unusually largesize child Exceptionally—ah—large They have the largest child's sizes Where is the boys' department inquired Mr Button shifting his ground desperately He felt that the clerk must surely scent his shameful secret Right here Well— He hesitated The notion of dressing his son in men's clothes was repugnant to him If say he could only find a very large boy's suit he might cut off that long and awful beard dye the white hair brown and thus manage to conceal the worst and to retain something of his own selfrespect—not to mention his position in Baltimore society But a frantic inspection of the boys' department revealed no suits to fit the newborn Button He blamed the store of course—in such cases it is the thing to blame the store How old did you say that boy of yours was demanded the clerk curiously He's—sixteen Oh I beg your pardon I thought you said six hours You'll find the youths' department in the next aisle Mr Button turned miserably away Then he stopped brightened and pointed his finger toward a dressed dummy in the window display There he exclaimed I'll take that suit out there on the dummy The clerk stared Why he protested that's not a child's suit At least it is but it's for fancy dress You could wear it yourself Wrap it up insisted his customer nervously That's what I want The astonished clerk obeyed Back at the hospital Mr Button entered the nursery and almost threw the package at his son Here's your clothes he snapped out The old man untied the package and viewed the contents with a quizzical eye They look sort of funny to me he complained I don't want to be made a monkey of—— You've made a monkey of me retorted Mr Button fiercely Never you mind how funny you look Put them on—or I'll—or I'll spank you He swallowed uneasily at the penultimate word feeling nevertheless that it was the proper thing to say All right father—this with a grotesque simulation of filial respect—you've lived longer you know best Just as you say As before the sound of the word father caused Mr Button to start violently And hurry I'm hurrying father When his son was dressed Mr Button regarded him with depression The costume consisted of dotted socks pink pants and a belted blouse with a wide white collar Over the latter waved the long whitish beard drooping almost to the waist The effect was not good Wait Mr Button seized a hospital shears and with three quick snaps amputated a large section of the beard But even with this improvement the ensemble fell far short of perfection The remaining brush of scraggly hair the watery eyes the ancient teeth seemed oddly out of tone with the gayety of the costume Mr Button however was obdurate—he held out his hand Come along he said sternly His son took the hand trustingly What are you going to call me dad he quavered as they walked from the nursery—just 'baby' for a while till you think of a better name Mr Button grunted I don't know he answered harshly I think we'll call you Methuselah Even after the new addition to the Button family had had his hair cut short and then dyed to a sparse unnatural black had had his face shaved so close that it glistened and had been attired in smallboy clothes made to order by a flabbergasted tailor it was impossible for Button to ignore the fact that his son was a poor excuse for a first family baby Despite his aged stoop Benjamin Button—for it was by this name they called him instead of by the appropriate but invidious Methuselah—was five feet eight inches tall His clothes did not conceal this nor did the clipping and dyeing of his eyebrows disguise the fact that the eyes underneath were faded and watery and tired In fact the babynurse who had been engaged in advance left the house after one look in a state of considerable indignation But Mr Button persisted in his unwavering purpose Benjamin was a baby and a baby he should remain At first he declared that if Benjamin didn't like warm milk he could go without food altogether but he was finally prevailed upon to allow his son bread and butter and even oatmeal by way of a compromise One day he brought home a rattle and giving it to Benjamin insisted in no uncertain terms that he should play with it whereupon the old man took it with a weary expression and could be heard jingling it obediently at intervals throughout the day There can be no doubt though that the rattle bored him and that he found other and more soothing amusements when he was left alone For instance Mr Button discovered one day that during the preceding week he had smoked more cigars than ever before—a phenomenon which was explained a few days later when entering the nursery unexpectedly he found the room full of faint blue haze and Benjamin with a guilty expression on his face trying to conceal the butt of a dark Havana This of course called for a severe spanking but Mr Button found that he could not bring himself to administer it He merely warned his son that he would stunt his growth Nevertheless he persisted in his attitude He brought home lead soldiers he brought toy trains he brought large pleasant animals made of cotton and to perfect the illusion which he was creating—for himself at least—he passionately demanded of the clerk in the toystore whether the paint would come off the pink duck if the baby put it in his mouth But despite all his father's efforts Benjamin refused to be interested He would steal down the back stairs and return to the nursery with a volume of the Encyclopædia Britannica over which he would pore through an afternoon while his cotton cows and his Noah's ark were left neglected on the floor Against such a stubbornness Mr Button's efforts were of little avail The sensation created in Baltimore was at first prodigious What the mishap would have cost the Buttons and their kinsfolk socially cannot be determined for the outbreak of the Civil War drew the city's attention to other things A few people who were unfailingly polite racked their brains for compliments to give to the parents—and finally hit upon the ingenious device of declaring that the baby resembled his grandfather a fact which due to the standard state of decay common to all men of seventy could not be denied Mr and Mrs Roger Button were not pleased and Benjamin's grandfather was furiously insulted Benjamin once he left the hospital took life as he found it Several small boys were brought to see him and he spent a stiffjointed afternoon trying to work up an interest in tops and marbles—he even managed quite accidentally to break a kitchen window with a stone from a sling shot a feat which secretly delighted his father Thereafter Benjamin contrived to break something every day but he did these things only because they were expected of him and because he was by nature obliging When his grandfather's initial antagonism wore off Benjamin and that gentleman took enormous pleasure in one another's company They would sit for hours these two so far apart in age and experience and like old cronies discuss with tireless monotony the slow events of the day Benjamin felt more at ease in his grandfather's presence than in his parents'—they seemed always somewhat in awe of him and despite the dictatorial authority they exercised over him frequently addressed him as Mr He was as puzzled as any one else at the apparently advanced age of his mind and body at birth He read up on it in the medical journal but found that no such case had been previously recorded At his father's urging he made an honest attempt to play with other boys and frequently he joined in the milder games—football shook him up too much and he feared that in case of a fracture his ancient bones would refuse to knit When he was five he was sent to kindergarten where he initiated into the art of pasting green paper on orange paper of weaving colored maps and manufacturing eternal cardboard necklaces He was inclined to drowse off to sleep in the middle of these tasks a habit which both irritated and frightened his young teacher To his relief she complained to his parents and he was removed from the school The Roger Buttons told their friends that they felt he was too young By the time he was twelve years old his parents had grown used to him Indeed so strong is the force of custom that they no longer felt that he was different from any other child—except when some curious anomaly reminded them of the fact But one day a few weeks after his twelfth birthday while looking in the mirror Benjamin made or thought he made an astonishing discovery Did his eyes deceive him or had his hair turned in the dozen years of his life from white to irongray under its concealing dye Was the network of wrinkles on his face becoming less pronounced Was his skin healthier and firmer with even a touch of ruddy winter color He could not tell He knew that he no longer stooped and that his physical condition had improved since the early days of his life Can it be—— he thought to himself or rather scarcely dared to think He went to his father I am grown he announced determinedly I want to put on long trousers His father hesitated Well he said finally I don't know Fourteen is the age for putting on long trousers—and you are only twelve But you'll have to admit protested Benjamin that I'm big for my age His father looked at him with illusory speculation Oh I'm not so sure of that he said I was as big as you when I was twelve This was not true—it was all part of Roger Button's silent agreement with himself to believe in his son's normality Finally a compromise was reached Benjamin was to continue to dye his hair He was to make a better attempt to play with boys of his own age He was not to wear his spectacles or carry a cane in the street In return for these concessions he was allowed his first suit of long trousers Of the life of Benjamin Button between his twelfth and twentyfirst year I intend to say little Suffice to record that they were years of normal ungrowth When Benjamin was eighteen he was erect as a man of fifty he had more hair and it was of a dark gray his step was firm his voice had lost its cracked quaver and descended to a healthy baritone So his father sent him up to Connecticut to take examinations for entrance to Yale College Benjamin passed his examination and became a member of the freshman class On the third day following his matriculation he received a notification from Mr Hart the college registrar to call at his office and arrange his schedule Benjamin glancing in the mirror decided that his hair needed a new application of its brown dye but an anxious inspection of his bureau drawer disclosed that the dye bottle was not there Then he remembered—he had emptied it the day before and thrown it away He was in a dilemma He was due at the registrar's in five minutes There seemed to be no help for it—he must go as he was He did Goodmorning said the registrar politely You've come to inquire about your son Why as a matter of fact my name's Button— began Benjamin but Mr Hart cut him off I'm very glad to meet you Mr Button I'm expecting your son here any minute That's me burst out Benjamin I'm a freshman What I'm a freshman Surely you're joking Not at all The registrar frowned and glanced at a card before him Why I have Mr Benjamin Button's age down here as eighteen That's my age asserted Benjamin flushing slightly The registrar eyed him wearily Now surely Mr Button you don't expect me to believe that Benjamin smiled wearily I am eighteen he repeated The registrar pointed sternly to the door Get out he said Get out of college and get out of town You are a dangerous lunatic I am eighteen Mr Hart opened the door The idea he shouted A man of your age trying to enter here as a freshman Eighteen years old are you Well I'll give you eighteen minutes to get out of town Benjamin Button walked with dignity from the room and half a dozen undergraduates who were waiting in the hall followed him curiously with their eyes When he had gone a little way he turned around faced the infuriated registrar who was still standing in the doorway and repeated in a firm voice I am eighteen years old To a chorus of titters which went up from the group of undergraduates Benjamin walked away But he was not fated to escape so easily On his melancholy walk to the railroad station he found that he was being followed by a group then by a swarm and finally by a dense mass of undergraduates The word had gone around that a lunatic had passed the entrance examinations for Yale and attempted to palm himself off as a youth of eighteen A fever of excitement permeated the college Men ran hatless out of classes the football team abandoned its practice and joined the mob professors' wives with bonnets awry and bustles out of position ran shouting after the procession from which proceeded a continual succession of remarks aimed at the tender sensibilities of Benjamin Button He must be the wandering Jew He ought to go to prep school at his age Look at the infant prodigy He thought this was the old men's home Go up to Harvard Benjamin increased his gait and soon he was running He would show them He would go to Harvard and then they would regret these illconsidered taunts Safely on board the train for Baltimore he put his head from the window You'll regret this he shouted Haha the undergraduates laughed Hahaha It was the biggest mistake that Yale College had ever made In 1880 Benjamin Button was twenty years old and he signalised his birthday by going to work for his father in Roger Button Co Wholesale Hardware It was in that same year that he began going out socially—that is his father insisted on taking him to several fashionable dances Roger Button was now fifty and he and his son were more and more companionable—in fact since Benjamin had ceased to dye his hair which was still grayish they appeared about the same age and could have passed for brothers One night in August they got into the phaeton attired in their fulldress suits and drove out to a dance at the Shevlins' country house situated just outside of Baltimore It was a gorgeous evening A full moon drenched the road to the lustreless color of platinum and lateblooming harvest flowers breathed into the motionless air aromas that were like low halfheard laughter The open country carpeted for rods around with bright wheat was translucent as in the day It was almost impossible not to be affected by the sheer beauty of the sky—almost There's a great future in the drygoods business Roger Button was saying He was not a spiritual man—his aesthetic sense was rudimentary Old fellows like me can't learn new tricks he observed profoundly It's you youngsters with energy and vitality that have the great future before you Far up the road the lights of the Shevlins' country house drifted into view and presently there was a sighing sound that crept persistently toward them—it might have been the fine plaint of violins or the rustle of the silver wheat under the moon They pulled up behind a handsome brougham whose passengers were disembarking at the door A lady got out then an elderly gentleman then another young lady beautiful as sin Benjamin started an almost chemical change seemed to dissolve and recompose the very elements of his body A rigor passed over him blood rose into his cheeks his forehead and there was a steady thumping in his ears It was first love The girl was slender and frail with hair that was ashen under the moon and honeycolored under the sputtering gaslamps of the porch Over her shoulders was thrown a Spanish mantilla of softest yellow butterflied in black her feet were glittering buttons at the hem of her bustled dress Roger Button leaned over to his son That he said is young Hildegarde Moncrief the daughter of General Moncrief Benjamin nodded coldly Pretty little thing he said indifferently But when the negro boy had led the buggy away he added Dad you might introduce me to her They approached a group of which Miss Moncrief was the centre Reared in the old tradition she curtsied low before Benjamin Yes he might have a dance He thanked her and walked away—staggered away The interval until the time for his turn should arrive dragged itself out interminably He stood close to the wall silent inscrutable watching with murderous eyes the young bloods of Baltimore as they eddied around Hildegarde Moncrief passionate admiration in their faces How obnoxious they seemed to Benjamin how intolerably rosy Their curling brown whiskers aroused in him a feeling equivalent to indigestion But when his own time came and he drifted with her out upon the changing floor to the music of the latest waltz from Paris his jealousies and anxieties melted from him like a mantle of snow Blind with enchantment he felt that life was just beginning You and your brother got here just as we did didn't you asked Hildegarde looking up at him with eyes that were like bright blue enamel Benjamin hesitated If she took him for his father's brother would it be best to enlighten her He remembered his experience at Yale so he decided against it It would be rude to contradict a lady it would be criminal to mar this exquisite occasion with the grotesque story of his origin Later perhaps So he nodded smiled listened was happy I like men of your age Hildegarde told him Young boys are so idiotic They tell me how much champagne they drink at college and how much money they lose playing cards Men of your age know how to appreciate women Benjamin felt himself on the verge of a proposal—with an effort he choked back the impulse You're just the romantic age she continued—fifty Twentyfive is too worldlywise thirty is apt to be pale from overwork forty is the age of long stories that take a whole cigar to tell sixty is—oh sixty is too near seventy but fifty is the mellow age I love fifty Fifty seemed to Benjamin a glorious age He longed passionately to be fifty I've always said went on Hildegarde that I'd rather marry a man of fifty and be taken care of than marry a man of thirty and take care of him For Benjamin the rest of the evening was bathed in a honeycoloured mist Hildegarde gave him two more dances and they discovered that they were marvellously in accord on all the questions of the day She was to go driving with him on the following Sunday and then they would discuss all these questions further Going home in the phaeton just before the crack of dawn when the first bees were humming and the fading moon glimmered in the cool dew Benjamin knew vaguely that his father was discussing wholesale hardware And what do you think should merit our biggest attention after hammers and nails the elder Button was saying Love replied Benjamin absentmindedly Lugs exclaimed Roger Button Why I've just covered the question of lugs Benjamin regarded him with dazed eyes just as the eastern sky was suddenly cracked with light and an oriole yawned piercingly in the quickening trees When six months later the engagement of Miss Hildegarde Moncrief to Mr Benjamin Button was made known I say made known for General Moncrief declared he would rather fall upon his sword than announce it the excitement in Baltimore society reached a feverish pitch The almost forgotten story of Benjamin's birth was remembered and sent out upon the winds of scandal in picaresque and incredible forms It was said that Benjamin was really the father of Roger Button that he was his brother who had been in prison for forty years that he was John Wilkes Booth in disguise—and finally that he had two small conical horns sprouting from his head The Sunday supplements of the New York papers played up the case with fascinating sketches which showed the head of Benjamin Button attached to a fish to a snake and finally to a body of solid brass He became known journalistically as the Mystery Man of Maryland But the true story as is usually the case had a very small circulation However every one agreed with General Moncrief that it was criminal for a lovely girl who could have married any beau in Baltimore to throw herself into the arms of a man who was assuredly fifty In vain Mr Roger Button published his son's birth certificate in large type in the Baltimore Blaze No one believed it You had only to look at Benjamin and see On the part of the two people most concerned there was no wavering So many of the stories about her fiancé were false that Hildegarde refused stubbornly to believe even the true one In vain General Moncrief pointed out to her the high mortality among men of fifty—or at least among men who looked fifty in vain he told her of the instability of the wholesale hardware business Hildegarde had chosen to marry for mellowness and marry she did In one particular at least the friends of Hildegarde Moncrief were mistaken The wholesale hardware business prospered amazingly In the fifteen years between Benjamin Button's marriage in 1880 and his father's retirement in 1895 the family fortune was doubled—and this was due largely to the younger member of the firm Needless to say Baltimore eventually received the couple to its bosom Even old General Moncrief became reconciled to his soninlaw when Benjamin gave him the money to bring out his History of the Civil War in twenty volumes which had been refused by nine prominent publishers In Benjamin himself fifteen years had wrought many changes It seemed to him that the blood flowed with new vigor through his veins It began to be a pleasure to rise in the morning to walk with an active step along the busy sunny street to work untiringly with his shipments of hammers and his cargoes of nails It was in 1890 that he executed his famous business coup he brought up the suggestion that all nails used in nailing up the boxes in which nails are shipped are the property of the shippee a proposal which became a statute was approved by Chief Justice Fossile and saved Roger Button and Company Wholesale Hardware more than six hundred nails every year In addition Benjamin discovered that he was becoming more and more attracted by the gay side of life It was typical of his growing enthusiasm for pleasure that he was the first man in the city of Baltimore to own and run an automobile Meeting him on the street his contemporaries would stare enviously at the picture he made of health and vitality He seems to grow younger every year they would remark And if old Roger Button now sixtyfive years old had failed at first to give a proper welcome to his son he atoned at last by bestowing on him what amounted to adulation And here we come to an unpleasant subject which it will be well to pass over as quickly as possible There was only one thing that worried Benjamin Button his wife had ceased to attract him At that time Hildegarde was a woman of thirtyfive with a son Roscoe fourteen years old In the early days of their marriage Benjamin had worshipped her But as the years passed her honeycolored hair became an unexciting brown the blue enamel of her eyes assumed the aspect of cheap crockery—moreover and most of all she had become too settled in her ways too placid too content too anemic in her excitements and too sober in her taste As a bride it had been she who had dragged Benjamin to dances and dinners—now conditions were reversed She went out socially with him but without enthusiasm devoured already by that eternal inertia which comes to live with each of us one day and stays with us to the end Benjamin's discontent waxed stronger At the outbreak of the SpanishAmerican War in 1898 his home had for him so little charm that he decided to join the army With his business influence he obtained a commission as captain and proved so adaptable to the work that he was made a major and finally a lieutenantcolonel just in time to participate in the celebrated charge up San Juan Hill He was slightly wounded and received a medal Benjamin had become so attached to the activity and excitement of army life that he regretted to give it up but his business required attention so he resigned his commission and came home He was met at the station by a brass band and escorted to his house Hildegarde waving a large silk flag greeted him on the porch and even as he kissed her he felt with a sinking of the heart that these three years had taken their toll She was a woman of forty now with a faint skirmish line of gray hairs in her head The sight depressed him Up in his room he saw his reflection in the familiar mirror—he went closer and examined his own face with anxiety comparing it after a moment with a photograph of himself in uniform taken just before the war Good Lord he said aloud The process was continuing There was no doubt of it—he looked now like a man of thirty Instead of being delighted he was uneasy—he was growing younger He had hitherto hoped that once he reached a bodily age equivalent to his age in years the grotesque phenomenon which had marked his birth would cease to function He shuddered His destiny seemed to him awful incredible When he came downstairs Hildegarde was waiting for him She appeared annoyed and he wondered if she had at last discovered that there was something amiss It was with an effort to relieve the tension between them that he broached the matter at dinner in what he considered a delicate way Well he remarked lightly everybody says I look younger than ever Hildegarde regarded him with scorn She sniffed Do you think it's anything to boast about I'm not boasting he asserted uncomfortably She sniffed again The idea she said and after a moment I should think you'd have enough pride to stop it How can I he demanded I'm not going to argue with you she retorted But there's a right way of doing things and a wrong way If you've made up your mind to be different from everybody else I don't suppose I can stop you but I really don't think it's very considerate But Hildegarde I can't help it You can too You're simply stubborn You think you don't want to be like any one else You always have been that way and you always will be But just think how it would be if every one else looked at things as you do—what would the world be like As this was an inane and unanswerable argument Benjamin made no reply and from that time on a chasm began to widen between them He wondered what possible fascination she had ever exercised over him To add to the breach he found as the new century gathered headway that his thirst for gayety grew stronger Never a party of any kind in the city of Baltimore but he was there dancing with the prettiest of the young married women chatting with the most popular of the debutantes and finding their company charming while his wife a dowager of evil omen sat among the chaperons now in haughty disapproval and now following him with solemn puzzled and reproachful eyes Look people would remark What a pity A young fellow that age tied to a woman of fortyfive He must be twenty years younger than his wife They had forgotten—as people inevitably forget—that back in 1880 their mammas and papas had also remarked about this same illmatched pair Benjamin's growing unhappiness at home was compensated for by his many new interests He took up golf and made a great success of it He went in for dancing in 1906 he was an expert at The Boston and in 1908 he was considered proficient at the Maxixe while in 1909 his Castle Walk was the envy of every young man in town His social activities of course interfered to some extent with his business but then he had worked hard at wholesale hardware for twentyfive years and felt that he could soon hand it on to his son Roscoe who had recently graduated from Harvard He and his son were in fact often mistaken for each other This pleased Benjamin—he soon forgot the insidious fear which had come over him on his return from the SpanishAmerican War and grew to take a naïve pleasure in his appearance There was only one fly in the delicious ointment—he hated to appear in public with his wife Hildegarde was almost fifty and the sight of her made him feel absurd One September day in 1910—a few years after Roger Button Co Wholesale Hardware had been handed over to young Roscoe Button—a man apparently about twenty years old entered himself as a freshman at Harvard University in Cambridge He did not make the mistake of announcing that he would never see fifty again nor did he mention the fact that his son had been graduated from the same institution ten years before He was admitted and almost immediately attained a prominent position in the class partly because he seemed a little older than the other freshmen whose average age was about eighteen But his success was largely due to the fact that in the football game with Yale he played so brilliantly with so much dash and with such a cold remorseless anger that he scored seven touchdowns and fourteen field goals for Harvard and caused one entire eleven of Yale men to be carried singly from the field unconscious He was the most celebrated man in college Strange to say in his third or junior year he was scarcely able to make the team The coaches said that he had lost weight and it seemed to the more observant among them that he was not quite as tall as before He made no touchdowns—indeed he was retained on the team chiefly in hope that his enormous reputation would bring terror and disorganisation to the Yale team In his senior year he did not make the team at all He had grown so slight and frail that one day he was taken by some sophomores for a freshman an incident which humiliated him terribly He became known as something of a prodigy—a senior who was surely no more than sixteen—and he was often shocked at the worldliness of some of his classmates His studies seemed harder to him—he felt that they were too advanced He had heard his classmates speak of St Midas' the famous preparatory school at which so many of them had prepared for college and he determined after his graduation to enter himself at St Midas' where the sheltered life among boys his own size would be more congenial to him Upon his graduation in 1914 he went home to Baltimore with his Harvard diploma in his pocket Hildegarde was now residing in Italy so Benjamin went to live with his son Roscoe But though he was welcomed in a general way there was obviously no heartiness in Roscoe's feeling toward him—there was even perceptible a tendency on his son's part to think that Benjamin as he moped about the house in adolescent mooniness was somewhat in the way Roscoe was married now and prominent in Baltimore life and he wanted no scandal to creep out in connection with his family Benjamin no longer persona grata with the débutantes and younger college set found himself left much alone except for the companionship of three or four fifteenyearold boys in the neighborhood His idea of going to St Midas school recurred to him Say he said to Roscoe one day I've told you over and over that I want to go to prep school Well go then replied Roscoe shortly The matter was distasteful to him and he wished to avoid a discussion I can't go alone said Benjamin helplessly You'll have to enter me and take me up there I haven't got time declared Roscoe abruptly His eyes narrowed and he looked uneasily at his father As a matter of fact he added you'd better not go on with this business much longer You better pull up short You better—you better—he paused and his face crimsoned as he sought for words—you better turn right around and start back the other way This has gone too far to be a joke It isn't funny any longer You—you behave yourself Benjamin looked at him on the verge of tears And another thing continued Roscoe when visitors are in the house I want you to call me 'Uncle'—not 'Roscoe' but 'Uncle' do you understand It looks absurd for a boy of fifteen to call me by my first name Perhaps you'd better call me 'Uncle' all the time so you'll get used to it With a harsh look at his father Roscoe turned away At the termination of this interview Benjamin wandered dismally upstairs and stared at himself in the mirror He had not shaved for three months but he could find nothing on his face but a faint white down with which it seemed unnecessary to meddle When he had first come home from Harvard Roscoe had approached him with the proposition that he should wear eyeglasses and imitation whiskers glued to his cheeks and it had seemed for a moment that the farce of his early years was to be repeated But whiskers had itched and made him ashamed He wept and Roscoe had reluctantly relented Benjamin opened a book of boys' stories The Boy Scouts in Bimini Bay and began to read But he found himself thinking persistently about the war America had joined the Allied cause during the preceding month and Benjamin wanted to enlist but alas sixteen was the minimum age and he did not look that old His true age which was fiftyseven would have disqualified him anyway There was a knock at his door and the butler appeared with a letter bearing a large official legend in the corner and addressed to Mr Benjamin Button Benjamin tore it open eagerly and read the enclosure with delight It informed him that many reserve officers who had served in the SpanishAmerican War were being called back into service with a higher rank and it enclosed his commission as brigadiergeneral in the United States army with orders to report immediately Benjamin jumped to his feet fairly quivering with enthusiasm This was what he had wanted He seized his cap and ten minutes later he had entered a large tailoring establishment on Charles Street and asked in his uncertain treble to be measured for a uniform Want to play soldier sonny demanded a clerk casually Benjamin flushed Say Never mind what I want he retorted angrily My name's Button and I live on Mt Vernon Place so you know I'm good for it Well admitted the clerk hesitantly if you're not I guess your daddy is all right Benjamin was measured and a week later his uniform was completed He had difficulty in obtaining the proper general's insignia because the dealer kept insisting to Benjamin that a nice Y W C A badge would look just as well and be much more fun to play with Saying nothing to Roscoe he left the house one night and proceeded by train to Camp Mosby in South Carolina where he was to command an infantry brigade On a sultry April day he approached the entrance to the camp paid off the taxicab which had brought him from the station and turned to the sentry on guard Get some one to handle my luggage he said briskly The sentry eyed him reproachfully Say he remarked where you goin' with the general's duds sonny Benjamin veteran of the SpanishAmerican War whirled upon him with fire in his eye but with alas a changing treble voice Come to attention he tried to thunder he paused for breath—then suddenly he saw the sentry snap his heels together and bring his rifle to the present Benjamin concealed a smile of gratification but when he glanced around his smile faded It was not he who had inspired obedience but an imposing artillery colonel who was approaching on horseback Colonel called Benjamin shrilly The colonel came up drew rein and looked coolly down at him with a twinkle in his eyes Whose little boy are you he demanded kindly I'll soon darn well show you whose little boy I am retorted Benjamin in a ferocious voice Get down off that horse The colonel roared with laughter You want him eh general Here cried Benjamin desperately Read this And he thrust his commission toward the colonel The colonel read it his eyes popping from their sockets Where'd you get this he demanded slipping the document into his own pocket I got it from the Government as you'll soon find out You come along with me said the colonel with a peculiar look We'll go up to headquarters and talk this over Come along The colonel turned and began walking his horse in the direction of headquarters There was nothing for Benjamin to do but follow with as much dignity as possible—meanwhile promising himself a stern revenge But this revenge did not materialize Two days later however his son Roscoe materialized from Baltimore hot and cross from a hasty trip and escorted the weeping general sans uniform back to his home In 1920 Roscoe Button's first child was born During the attendant festivities however no one thought it the thing to mention that the little grubby boy apparently about ten years of age who played around the house with lead soldiers and a miniature circus was the new baby's own grandfather No one disliked the little boy whose fresh cheerful face was crossed with just a hint of sadness but to Roscoe Button his presence was a source of torment In the idiom of his generation Roscoe did not consider the matter efficient It seemed to him that his father in refusing to look sixty had not behaved like a redblooded heman—this was Roscoe's favorite expression—but in a curious and perverse manner Indeed to think about the matter for as much as a half an hour drove him to the edge of insanity Roscoe believed that live wires should keep young but carrying it out on such a scale was—was—was inefficient And there Roscoe rested Five years later Roscoe's little boy had grown old enough to play childish games with little Benjamin under the supervision of the same nurse Roscoe took them both to kindergarten on the same day and Benjamin found that playing with little strips of colored paper making mats and chains and curious and beautiful designs was the most fascinating game in the world Once he was bad and had to stand in the corner—then he cried—but for the most part there were gay hours in the cheerful room with the sunlight coming in the windows and Miss Bailey's kind hand resting for a moment now and then in his tousled hair Roscoe's son moved up into the first grade after a year but Benjamin stayed on in the kindergarten He was very happy Sometimes when other tots talked about what they would do when they grew up a shadow would cross his little face as if in a dim childish way he realized that those were things in which he was never to share The days flowed on in monotonous content He went back a third year to the kindergarten but he was too little now to understand what the bright shining strips of paper were for He cried because the other boys were bigger than he and he was afraid of them The teacher talked to him but though he tried to understand he could not understand at all He was taken from the kindergarten His nurse Nana in her starched gingham dress became the centre of his tiny world On bright days they walked in the park Nana would point at a great gray monster and say elephant and Benjamin would say it after her and when he was being undressed for bed that night he would say it over and over aloud to her Elyphant elyphant elyphant Sometimes Nana let him jump on the bed which was fun because if you sat down exactly right it would bounce you up on your feet again and if you said Ah for a long time while you jumped you got a very pleasing broken vocal effect He loved to take a big cane from the hatrack and go around hitting chairs and tables with it and saying Fight fight fight When there were people there the old ladies would cluck at him which interested him and the young ladies would try to kiss him which he submitted to with mild boredom And when the long day was done at five o'clock he would go upstairs with Nana and be fed oatmeal and nice soft mushy foods with a spoon There were no troublesome memories in his childish sleep no token came to him of his brave days at college of the glittering years when he flustered the hearts of many girls There were only the white safe walls of his crib and Nana and a man who came to see him sometimes and a great big orange ball that Nana pointed at just before his twilight bed hour and called sun When the sun went his eyes were sleepy—there were no dreams no dreams to haunt him The past—the wild charge at the head of his men up San Juan Hill the first years of his marriage when he worked late into the summer dusk down in the busy city for young Hildegarde whom he loved the days before that when he sat smoking far into the night in the gloomy old Button house on Monroe Street with his grandfather—all these had faded like unsubstantial dreams from his mind as though they had never been He did not remember He did not remember clearly whether the milk was warm or cool at his last feeding or how the days passed—there was only his crib and Nana's familiar presence And then he remembered nothing When he was hungry he cried—that was all Through the noons and nights he breathed and over him there were soft mumblings and murmurings that he scarcely heard and faintly differentiated smells and light and darkness Then it was all dark and his white crib and the dim faces that moved above him and the warm sweet aroma of the milk faded out altogether from his mind MR ICKY THE QUINTESSENCE OF

folks who want a story and not just a lot of psychological stuff or analysis Boy you'll love it Read it here see it in the movies play it on the phonograph run it through the sewingmachine A WILD THING It was night in the mountains of Kentucky Wild hills rose on all sides Swift mountain streams flowed rapidly up and down the mountains Jemima Tantrum was down at the stream brewing whiskey at the family still She was a typical mountain girl Her feet were bare Her hands large and powerful hung down below her knees Her face showed the ravages of work Although but sixteen she had for over a dozen years been supporting her aged pappy and mappy by brewing mountain whiskey From time to time she would pause in her task and filling a dipper full of the pure invigorating liquid would drain it off—then pursue her work with renewed vigor She would place the rye in the vat thresh it out with her feet and in twenty minutes the completed product would be turned out A sudden cry made her pause in the act of draining a dipper and look up Hello said a voice It came from a man clad in hunting boots reaching to his neck who had emerged Can you tell me the way to the Tantrums' cabin Are you uns from the settlements down thar She pointed her hand down to the bottom of the hill where Louisville lay She had never been there but once before she was born her greatgrandfather old Gore Tantrum had gone into the settlements in the company of two marshals and had never come back So the Tantrums from generation to generation had learned to dread civilization The man was amused He laughed a light tinkling laugh the laugh of a Philadelphian Something in the ring of it thrilled her She drank off another dipper of whiskey Where is Mr Tantrum little girl he asked not without kindness She raised her foot and pointed her big toe toward the woods Thar in the cabing behind those thar pines Old Tantrum air my old man The man from the settlements thanked her and strode off He was fairly vibrant with youth and personality As he walked along he whistled and sang and turned handsprings and flapjacks breathing in the fresh cool air of the mountains The air around the still was like wine Jemina Tantrum watched him entranced No one like him had ever come into her life before She sat down on the grass and counted her toes She counted eleven She had learned arithmetic in the mountain school A MOUNTAIN FEUD Ten years before a lady from the settlements had opened a school on the mountain Jemina had no money but she had paid her way in whiskey bringing a pailful to school every morning and leaving it on Miss Lafarge's desk Miss Lafarge had died of delirium tremens after a year's teaching and so Jemina's education had stopped Across the still stream still another still was standing It was that of the Doldrums The Doldrums and the Tantrums never exchanged calls They hated each other Fifty years before old Jem Doldrum and old Jem Tantrum had quarrelled in the Tantrum cabin over a game of slapjack Jem Doldrum had thrown the king of hearts in Jem Tantrum's face and old Tantrum enraged had felled the old Doldrum with the nine of diamonds Other Doldrums and Tantrums had joined in and the little cabin was soon filled with flying cards Harstrum Doldrum one of the younger Doldrums lay stretched on the floor writhing in agony the ace of hearts crammed down his throat Jem Tantrum standing in the doorway ran through suit after suit his face alight with fiendish hatred Old Mappy Tantrum stood on the table wetting down the Doldrums with hot whiskey Old Heck Doldrum having finally run out of trumps was backed out of the cabin striking left and right with his tobacco pouch and gathering around him the rest of his clan Then they mounted their steers and galloped furiously home That night old man Doldrum and his sons vowing vengeance had returned put a ticktock on the Tantrum window stuck a pin in the doorbell and beaten a retreat A week later the Tantrums had put Cod Liver Oil in the Doldrums' still and so from year to year the feud had continued first one family being entirely wiped out then the other THE BIRTH OF LOVE Every day little Jemina worked the still on her side of the stream and Boscoe Doldrum worked the still on his side Sometimes with automatic inherited hatred the feudists would throw whiskey at each other and Jemina would come home smelling like a French table d'hôte But now Jemina was too thoughtful to look across the stream How wonderful the stranger had been and how oddly he was dressed In her innocent way she had never believed that there were any civilized settlements at all and she had put the belief in them down to the credulity of the mountain people She turned to go up to the cabin and as she turned something struck her in the neck It was a sponge thrown by Boscoe Doldrum—a sponge soaked in whiskey from his still on the other side of the stream Hi thar Boscoe Doldrum she shouted in her deep bass voice Yo Jemina Tantrum Gosh ding yo' he returned She continued her way to the cabin The stranger was talking to her father Gold had been discovered on the Tantrum land and the stranger Edgar Edison was trying to buy the land for a song He was considering what song to offer She sat upon her hands and watched him He was wonderful When he talked his lips moved She sat upon the stove and watched him Suddenly there came a bloodcurdling scream The Tantrums rushed to the windows It was the Doldrums They had hitched their steers to trees and concealed themselves behind the bushes and flowers and soon a perfect rattle of stones and bricks beat against the windows bending them inward Father father shrieked Jemina Her father took down his slingshot from his slingshot rack on the wall and ran his hand lovingly over the elastic band He stepped to a loophole Old Mappy Tantrum stepped to the coalhole A MOUNTAIN BATTLE The stranger was aroused at last Furious to get at the Doldrums he tried to escape from the house by crawling up the chimney Then he thought there might be a door under the bead but Jemina told him there was not He hunted for doors under the beds and sofas but each time Jemina pulled him out and told him there were no doors there Furious with anger he beat upon the door and hollered at the Doldrums They did not answer him but kept up their fusillade of bricks and stones against the window Old Pappy Tantrum knew that just as soon as they were able to affect an aperture they would pour in and the fight would be over Then old Heck Doldrum foaming at the mouth and expectorating on the ground left and right led the attack The terrific slingshots of Pappy Tantrum had not been without their effect A master shot had disabled one Doldrum and another Doldrum shot almost incessantly through the abdomen fought feebly on Nearer and nearer they approached the house We must fly shouted the stranger to Jemina I will sacrifice myself and bear you away No shouted Pappy Tantrum his face begrimed You stay here and fit on I will bar Jemina away I will bar Mappy away I will bar myself away The man from the settlements pale and trembling with anger turned to Ham Tantrum who stood at the door throwing loophole after loophole at the advancing Doldrums Will you cover the retreat But Ham said that he too had Tantrums to bear away but that he would leave himself here to help the stranger cover the retreat if he could think of a way of doing it Soon smoke began to filter through the floor and ceiling Shem Doldrum had come up and touched a match to old Japhet Tantrum's breath as he leaned from a loophole and the alcoholic flames shot up on all sides The whiskey in the bathtub caught fire The walls began to fall in Jemina and the man from the settlements looked at each other Jemina he whispered Stranger she answered We will die together he said If we had lived I would have taken you to the city and married you With your ability to hold liquor your social success would have been assured She caressed him idly for a moment counting her toes softly to herself The smoke grew thicker Her left leg was on fire She was a human alcohol lamp Their lips met in one long kiss and then a wall fell on them and blotted them out As One When the Doldrums burst through the ring of flame they found them dead where they had fallen their arms about each other Old Jem Doldrum was moved He took off his hat He filled it with whiskey and drank it off They air dead he said slowly they hankered after each other The fit is over now We must not part them So they threw them together into the stream and the two splashes they made were as one ",

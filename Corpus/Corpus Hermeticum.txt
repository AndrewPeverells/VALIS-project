"CORPUS_HERMETICUM I Poemandres the Shepherd of Men It chanced once on a time my mind was meditating on the things that are my thought was raised to a great height the senses of my body being held back just as men who are weighed down with sleep after a fill of food or from fatigue of body Methought a Being more than vast in size beyond all bounds called out my name and saith What wouldst thou hear and see and what hast thou in mind to learn and know And I do say Who art thou He saith I am Man Shepherd Poemandres Mind of ail masterhood I know what thou desirest and I'm with thee everywhere And I reply I long to learn the things that are and comprehend their nature and know God This is I said what I desire to hear He answered back to me Hold in thy mind all thou wouldst know and I will teach thee E en with these words His aspect changed and straightway in the twinkling of an eye all things were opened to me and I see a Vision limitless all things turned into Light sweet joyous Light And I became transported as I gazed But in a little while Darkness came settling down on part of it awesome and gloomy coiling in sinuous folds so that methought it like unto a snake And then the Darkness changed into some sort of a Moist Nature tossed about beyond all power of words belching out smoke as from a fire and groaning forth a wailing sound that beggars all description And after that an outcry inarticulate came forth from it as though it were a Voice of Fire Thereon out of the Light a Holy Word Logos descended on that Nature And upwards to the height from the Moist Nature leaped forth pure Fire light was it swift and active too The Air too being light followed after the Fire from out of the Earth and Water rising up to Fire so that it seemed to hang therefrom But Earth and Water stayed so mingled with each other that Earth from Water no one could discern Yet were they moved to hear by reason of the Spirit Word Logos pervading them Then saith to me Man Shepherd Didst understand this Vision what it means Nay that shall I know said I That Light He said am I thy God Mind prior to Moist Nature which appeared from Darkness the Light Word Logos that appeared from Mind is Son of God What then say I Know that what sees in thee and hears is the Lord s Word Logos but Mind is Father God Not separate are they the one from other just in their union rather is it Life consists Thanks be to Thee I said So understand the Light He answered and make friends with it And speaking thus He gazed for long into my eyes so that I trembled at the look of him But when He raised His head I see in Mind the Light but now in Powers no man could number and Cosmos grown beyond all bounds and that the Fire was compassed round about by a most mighty Power and now subdued had come unto a stand And when I saw these things I understood by reason of Man Shepherd s Word Logos But as I was in great astonishment He saith to me again Thou didst behold in Mind the Archetypal Form whose being is before beginning without end Thus spake to me Man Shepherd And I say Whence then have Nature s elements their being To this He answer gives From Will of God Nature received the Word Logos and gazing upon the Cosmos Beautiful did copy it making herself into a cosmos by means of her own elements and by the births of souls And God the Mind being male and female both as Light and Life subsisting brought forth another Mind to give things form who God as he was of Fire and Spirit formed Seven Rulers who enclose the cosmos that the sense perceives Men call their ruling Fate Straightway from out the downward elements God s Reason Logos leaped up to Nature s pure formation and was at oned with the Formative Mind for it was co essential with it And Nature s downward elements were thus left reason less so as to be pure matter Then the Formative Mind at oned with Reason he who surrounds the spheres and spins them with his whorl set turning his formations and let them turn from a beginning boundless unto an endless end For that the circulation of these spheres begins where it doth end as Mind doth will And from the downward elements Nature brought forth lives reason less for He did not extend the Reason Logos to them The Air brought forth things winged the Water things that swim and Earth and Water one from another parted as Mind willed And from her bosom Earth produced what lives she had four footed things and reptiles beasts wild and tame But All Father Mind being Life and Light did bring forth Man co equal to Himself with whom He fell in love as being His own child for he was beautiful beyond compare the Image of his Sire In very truth God fell in love with his own Form and on him did bestow all of His own formations And when he gazed upon what the Enformer had created in the Father Man too wished to enform and so assent was given him by the Father Changing his state to the formative sphere in that he was to have his whole authority he gazed upon his Brother s creatures They fell in love with him and gave him each a share of his own ordering And after that he had well learned their essence and had become a sharer in their nature he had a mind to break right through the Boundary of their spheres and to subdue the might of that which pressed upon the Fire So he who hath the whole authority o er all the mortals in the cosmos and o er its lives irrational bent his face downwards through the Harmony breaking right through its strength and showed to downward Nature God s fair form And when she saw that Form of beauty which can never satiate and him who now possessed within himself each single energy of all seven Rulers as well as God s own Form she smiled with love for twas as though she d seen the image of Man s fairest form upon her Water his shadow on her Earth He in turn beholding the form like to himself existing in her in her Water loved it and willed to live in it and with the will came act and so he vivified the form devoid of reason And Nature took the object of her love and wound herself completely around him and they were intermingled for they were lovers And this is why beyond all creatures on the earth man is twofold mortal because of body but because of the essential man immortal Though deathless and possessed of sway o er all yet doth he suffer as a mortal doth subject to Fate Thus though above the Harmony within the Harmony he hath become a slave Though male female as from a Father male female and though he s sleepless from a sleepless Sire yet is he overcome by sleep Thereon I say Teach on O Mind of me for I myself as well am amorous of the Word Logos The Shepherd said This is the mystery kept hid until this day Nature embraced by Man brought forth a wonder oh so wonderful For as he had the nature of the Concord of the Seven who as I said to thee were made of Fire and Spirit Nature delayed not but immediately brought forth seven men in correspondence with the natures of the Seven male female and moving in the air Thereon I said O Shepherd for now I'm filled with great desire and long to hear do not run off The Shepherd said Keep silence for not as yet have I unrolled for thee the first discourse logoi Lo I am still I said In such wise than as I have said the generation of these seven came to pass Earth was as woman her Water filled with longing ripeness she took from Fire spirit from Aether Nature thus brought forth frames to suit the form of Man And Man from Light and Life changed into soul and mind from Life to soul from Light to mind And thus continued all the sense world s parts until the period of their end and new beginnings Now listen to the rest of the discourse Logos which thou dost long to hear The period being ended the bond that bound them all was loosened by God s Will For all the animals being male female at the same time with Man were loosed apart some became partly male some in like fashion partly female And straightway God spake by His Holy Word Logos Increase ye in increasing and multiply in multitude ye creatures and creations all and man that hath Mind in him let him learn to know that he himself is deathless and that the cause of death is love though Love is all When He said this His Forethought did by means of Fate and Harmony effect their couplings and their generations founded And so all things were multiplied according to their kind And he who thus hath learned to know himself hath reached that Good which doth transcend abundance but he who through a love that leads astray expends his love upon his body he stays in Darkness wandering and suffering through his senses things of Death What is the so great fault said I the ignorant commit that they should be deprived of deathlessness Thou seem st He said O thou not to have given heed to what thou heardest Did I not bid thee think Yea do I think and I remember and therefore give Thee thanks If thou didst think thereon said He tell me Why do they merit death who are in Death It is because the gloomy Darkness is the root and base of the material frame from it came the Moist Nature from this the body in the sense world was composed and from this body Death doth the Water drain Right was thy thought O thou But how doth he who knows himself go unto Him as God s Word Logos hath declared And I reply the Father of the universals doth consist of Light and Life from Him Man was born Thou sayest well thus speaking Light and Life is Father God and from Him Man was born If then thou learnest that thou art thyself of Life and Light and that thou happen st to be out of them thou shalt return again to Life Thus did Man Shepherd speak But tell me further Mind of me I cried how shall I come to Life again for God doth say The man who hath Mind in him let him learn to know that he himself is deathless Have not all men then Mind Thou sayest well O thou thus speaking I Mind myself am present with holy men and good the pure and merciful men who live piously To such my presence doth become an aid and straightway they gain gnosis of all things and win the Father s love by their pure lives and give Him thanks invoking on Him blessings and chanting hymns intent on Him with ardent love And ere they give up the body unto its proper death they turn them with disgust from its sensations from knowledge of what things they operate Nay it is I the Mind that will not let the operations which befall the body work to their natural end For being door keeper I ll close up all the entrances and cut the mental actions off which base and evil energies induce But to the Mind less ones the wicked and depraved the envious and covetous and those who mured do and love impiety I am far off yielding my place to the Avenging Daimon who sharpening the fire tormenteth him and addeth fire to fire upon him and rusheth upon him through his senses thus rendering him readier for transgressions of the law so that he meets with greater torment nor doth he ever cease to have desire for appetites inordinate insatiately striving in the dark Well hast thou taught me all as I desired O Mind And now pray tell me further of the nature of the Way Above as now it is for me To this Man Shepherd said When the material body is to be dissolved first thou surrenderest the body by itself unto the work of change and thus the form thou hadst doth vanish and thou surrenderest thy way of life void of its energy unto the Daimon The body s senses next pass back into their sources becoming separate and resurrect as energies and passion and desire withdraw unto that nature which is void of reason And thus it is that man doth speed his way thereafter upwards through the Harmony To the first zone he gives the Energy of Growth and Waning unto the second zone Device of Evils now de energized unto the third the Guile of the Desires de energized unto the fourth his Domineering Arrogance also de energized unto the fifth unholy Daring and the Rashness of Audacity de energized unto the sixth Striving for Wealth by evil means deprived of its aggrandizement and to the seventh zone Ensnaring Falsehood de energized And then with all the energisings of the harmony stript from him clothed in his proper Power he cometh to that Nature which belongs unto the Eighth and there with those that are hymneth the Father They who are there welcome his coming there with joy and he made like to them that sojourn there doth further hear the Powers who are above the Nature that belongs unto the Eighth singing their songs of praise to God in language of their own And then they in a band go to the Father home of their own selves they make surrender of themselves to Powers and thus becoming Powers they are in God This the good end for those who have gained Gnosis to be made one with God Why shouldst thou then delay Must it not be since thou hast all received that thou shouldst to the worthy point the way in order that through thee the race of mortal kind may by thy God be saved This when He d said Man Shepherd mingled with the Powers But I with thanks and belssings unto the Father of the universal Powers was freed full of the power he had poured into me and full of what He d taught me of the nature of the All and of the loftiest Vision And I began to preach unto men the Beauty of Devotion and of Gnosis O ye people earth born folk ye who have given yourselves to drunkenness and sleep and ignorance of God be sober now cease from your surfeit cease to be glamoured by irrational sleep And when they heard they came with one accord Whereon I say Ye earth born folk why have ye given yourselves up to Death while yet ye have the power of sharing Deathlessness Repent O ye who walk with Error arm in arm and make of Ignorance the sharer of your board get ye out from the light of Darkness and take your part in Deathlessness forsake Destruction And some of them with jests upon their lips departed from me abandoning themselves unto the Way of Death others entreated to be taught casting themselves before my feet But I made them arise and I became a leader of the Race towards home teaching the words logoi how and in what way they shall be saved I sowed in them the words logoi of wisdom of Deathless Water were they given to drink And when even was come and all sun s beams began to set I bade them all give thanks to God And when they had brought to an end the giving of their thanks each man returned to his own resting place But I recorded in my heart Man Shepherd s benefaction and with my every hope fulfilled more than rejoiced For body s sleep became the soul s awakening and closing of the eyes true vision pregnant with Good my silence and the utterance of my word logos begetting of good things All this befell me from my Mind that is Man Shepherd Word Logos of all masterhood by whom being God inspired I came unto the Plain of Truth Wherefore with all my soul and strength thanksgiving give I unto Father God Holy art Thou O God the universals Father Holy art Thou O God whose Will perfects itself by means of its own Powers Holy art Thou O God who willeth to be known and art known by Thine own Holy art Thou who didst by Word Logos make to consist the things that are Holy art Thou of whom All nature hath been made an image Holy art Thou whose Form Nature hath never made Holy art Thou more powerful than all power Holy art Thou transcending all pre eminence Holy Thou art Thou better than all praise Accept my reason s offerings pure from soul and heart for aye stretched up to Thee O Thou unutterable unspeakable Whose Name naught but the Silence can express Give ear to me who pray that I may ne er of Gnosis fail Gnosis which is our common being s nature and fill me with Thy Power and with this Grace of Thine that I may give the Light to those in ignorance of the Race my Brethren and Thy Sons For this cause I believe and I bear witness I go to Life and Light Blessed art Thou O Father Thy Man would holy be as Thou art holy e en as Thou gave him Thy full authority to be Hermes All that is moved Asclepius is it not moved in something and by something Asclepius Assuredly H And must not that in which it s moved be greater than the moved A It must H Mover again has greater power than moved A It has of course H The nature furthermore of that in which it s moved must be quite other from the nature of the moved A It must completely H Is not again this cosmos vast so vast that than it there exists no body greater A Assuredly H And massive too for it is crammed with multitudes of other mighty frames nay rather all the other bodies that there are A It is H And yet the cosmos is a body A It is a body H And one that s moved A Assuredly H Of what size then must be the space in which it s moved and of what kind must be the nature of that space Must it not be far vaster than the cosmos in order that it may be able to find room for its continued course so that the moved may not be cramped for want of room and lose its motion A Something Thrice greatest one it needs must be immensely vast H And of what nature Must it not be Asclepius of just the contrary And is not contrary to body bodiless A Agreed H Space then is bodiless But bodiless must either be some godlike thing or God Himself And by some godlike thing I mean no more the generable i e that which is generated but the ingenerable If then space be some godlike thing it is substantial but if tis God Himself it transcends substance But it is to be thought of otherwise than God and in this way God is first thinkable for us not for Himself for that the thing that s thought doth fall beneath the thinker s sense God then cannot be thinkable unto Himself in that He s thought of by Himself as being nothing else but what He thinks But he is something else for us and so He s thought of by us If space is therefore to be thought it should not then be thought as God but space If God is also to be thought He should not be conceived as space but as energy that can contain all space Further all that is moved is moved not in the moved but in the stable And that which moves another is of course stationary for tis impossible that it should move with it A How is it then that things down here Thrice greatest one are moved with those that are already moved For thou hast said the errant spheres were moved by the inerrant one H This is not O Asclepius a moving with but one against they are not moved with one another but one against the other It is this contrariety which turneth the resistance of their motion into rest For that resistance is the rest of motion Hence too the errant spheres being moved contrarily to the inerrant one are moved by one another by mutual contrariety and also by the spable one through contrariety itself And this can otherwise not be The Bears up there which neither set nor rise think st thou they rest or move A They move Thrice greatest one H And what their motion my Asclepius A Motion that turns for ever round the same H But revolution motion around same is fixed by rest For round the same doth stop beyond same Beyond same then being stopped if it be steadied in round same the contrary stands firm being rendered ever stable by its contrariety Of this I ll give thee here on earth an instance which the eye can see Regard the animals down here a man for instance swimming The water moves yet the resistance of his hands and feet give him stability so that he is not borne along with it nor sunk thereby A Thou hast Thrice greatest one adduced a most clear instance H All motion then is caused in station and by station The motion therefore of the cosmos and of every other hylic animal will not be caused by things exterior to the cosmos but by things interior outward to the exterior such things as soul or spirit or some such other thing incorporeal Tis not the body that doth move the living thing in it nay not even the whole body of the universe a lesser body e en though there be no life in it A What meanest thou by this Thrice greatest one Is it not bodies then that move the stock and stone and all the other things inanimate H By no means O Asclepius The something in the body the that which moves the thing inanimate this surely s not a body for that it moves the two of them both body of the lifter and the lifted So that a thing that s lifeless will not move a lifeless thing That which doth move another thing is animate in that it is the mover Thou seest then how heavy laden is the soul for it alone doth lift two bodies That things moreover moved are moved in something as well as moved by something is clear A Yea O Thrice greatest one things moved must needs be moved in something void H Thou sayest well O my Asclepius For naught of things that are is void Alone the is not is void and stranger to subsistence For that which is subsistent can never change to void A Are there then O Thrice greatest one no such things as an empty cask for instance and an empty jar a cup and vat and other things like unto them H Alack Asclepius for thy far wandering from the truth Think st thou that things most full and most replete are void A How meanest thou Thrice greatest one H Is not air body A It is H And doth this body not pervade all things and so pervading fill them And body doth body not consist from blending of the four Full then of air are all thou callest void and if of air then of the four Further of this the converse follows that all thou callest full are void of air for that they have their space filled out with other bodies and therefore are not able to receive the air therein These then which thou dost say are void they should be hollow named not void for they not only are but they are full of air and spirit A Thy argument logos Thrice greatest one is not to be gainsaid air is a body Further it is this body which doth pervade all things and so pervading fill them What are we then to call that space in which the all doth move H The bodiless Asclepius A What then is Bodiless H Tis Mind and Reason logos whole out of whole all self embracing free from all body from all error free unsensible to body and untouchable self stayed in self containing all preserving those that are whose rays to use a likeness are Good Truth Light beyond light the Archetype of soul A What then is God H Not any one of these is He for He it is that causeth them to be both all and each and every thing of all that are Nor hath He left a thing beside that is not but they are all from things that are and not from things that are not For that the things that are not have naturally no power of being anything but naturally have the power of the inability to be And conversely the things that are have not the nature of some time not being A What say st thou ever then God is H God therefore is not Mind but Cause that the Mind is God is not Spirit but Cause that Spirit is God is not Light but Cause that the Light is Hence one should honor God with these two names the Good and Father names which pertain to Him alone and no one else For no one of the other so called gods no one of men or daimones can be in any measure Good but God alone and He is Good alone and nothing else The rest of things are separable all from the Good s nature for all the rest are soul and body which have no place that can contain the Good For that as mighty is the Greatness of the Good as is the Being of all things that are both bodies and things bodiless things sensible and intelligible things Call thou not therefore aught else Good for thou would st imious be nor anything at all at any time call God but Good alone for so thou would st again be impious Though then the Good is spoken of by all it is not understood by all what thing it is Not only then is God not understood by all but both unto the gods and some of the men they out of ignorance do give the name of Good though they can never either be or become Good For they are very different from God while Good can never be distinguished from Him for that God is the same as Good The rest of the immortal ones are nonetheless honored with the name of God and spoken of as gods but God is Good not out of courtesy but out of nature For that God s nature and the Good is one one os the kind of both from which all other kinds proceed The Good is he who gives all things and naught receives God then doth give all things and receive naught God then is Good and Good is God The other name of God is Father again because He is the that which maketh all The part of father is to make Wherefore child making is a very great and a most pious thing in life for them who think aright and to leave life on earth without a child a very great misfortune and impiety and he who hath no child is punished by the daimones after death And this is the punishment that that man s soul who hath no child shall be condemned unto a body with neither man s nor woman s nature a thing accursed beneath the sun Wherefore Asclepius let not your sympathies be with the man who hath no child but rather pity his mishap knowing what punishment abides for him Let all that has been said then be to thee Asclepius an introduction to the gnosis of the nature of all things The Glory of all things is God Godhead and Godly Nature Source of the things that are is God who is both Mind and Nature yea Matter the Wisdom that reveals all things Source too is Godhead yea Nature Energy Necessity and End and Making new again Darkness that knew no bounds was in Abyss and Water too and subtle Breath intelligent these were by Power of God in Chaos Then Holy Light arose and there collected neath Dry Space from out Moist Essence Elements and all the Gods do separate things out from fecund Nature All things being undefined and yet unwrought the light things were assigned unto the height the heavy ones had their foundations laid down underneath the moist part of Dry Space the universal things being bounded off by Fire and hanged in Breath to keep them up And Heaven was seen in seven circles its Gods were visible in forms of stars with all their signs while Nature had her members made articulate together with the Gods in her And Heaven s periphery revolved in cyclic course borne on by Breath of God And every God by his own proper power brought forth what was appointed him Thus there arose four footed beasts and creeping things and those that in the water dwell and things with wings and everything that beareth seed and grass and shoot of every flower all having in themselves seed of again becoming And they selected out the births of men for gnosis of the works of God and attestation of the energy of Nature the multitude of men for lordship over all beneath the heaven and gnosis of its blessings that they might increase in increasing and multiply in multitude and every soul infleshed by revolution of the Cyclic Gods for observation of the marvels of Heaven and Heaven s Gods revolution and of the works of God and energy of Nature for tokens of its blessings for gnosis of the power of God that they might know the fates that follow good and evil deeds and learn the cunning work of all good arts Thus there begins their living and their growing wise according to the fate appointed by the revolution of the Cyclic Gods and their deceasing for this end And there shall be memorials mighty of their handiworks upon the earth leaving dim trace behind when cycles are renewed For every birth of flesh ensouled and of the fruit of seed and every handiwork though it decay shall of necessity renew itself both by the renovation of the Gods and by the turning round of Nature s rhythmic wheel For that whereas the Godhead is Nature s ever making new again the cosmic mixture Nature herself is also co established in that Godhead Hermes With Reason Logos not with hands did the World maker make the universal World so that thou shouldst think of him as everywhere and ever being the Author of all things and One and Only who by His Will all beings hath created This Body of Him is a thing no man can touch or see or measure a body inextensible like to no other frame Tis neither Fire nor Water Air nor Breath yet all of them come from it Now being Good he willed to consecrate this Body to Himself alone and set its Earth in order and adorn it So down to Earth He sent the Cosmos of this Frame Divine man a life that cannot die and yet a life that dies And o er all other lives and over Cosmos too did man excel by reason of the Reason Logos and the Mind For contemplator of God s works did man become he marvelled and did strive to know their Author Reason Logos indeed O Tat among all men hath He distributed but Mind not yet not that He grudgeth any for grudging cometh not from Him but hath its place below within the souls of men who have no Mind Tat Why then did God O father not on all bestow a share of Mind H He willed my son to have it set up in the midst for souls just as it were a prize T And where hath He set it up H He filled a mighty Cup with it and sent it down joining a Herald to it to whom He gave command to make this proclamation to the hearts of men Baptize thyself with this Cup s baptism what heart can do so thou that hast faith thou canst ascend to him that hath sent down the Cup thou that dost know for what thoudidst come into being As many then as understood the Herald s tidings and doused themselves in Mind became partakers in the Gnosis and when they had received the Mind they were made perfect men But they who do not understand the tidings these since they possess the aid of Reason only and not Mind are ignorant wherefor they have come into being and whereby The senses of such men are like irrational creatures and as their whole make up is in their feelings and their impulses they fail in all appreciation of those things which really are worth contemplation These center all their thought upon the pleasures of the body and its appetites in the belief that for its sake man hath come into being But they who have received some portion of God s gift these Tat if we judge by their deeds have from Death s bonds won their release for they embrace in their own Mind all things things on the earth things in the heaven and things above the heaven if there be aught And having raised themselves so far they sight the Good and having sighted it they look upon their sojourn here as a mischance and in disdain of all both things in body and the bodiless they speed their way unto that One and Only One This is O Tat the Gnosis of the Mind Vision of things Divine God knowledge is it for the Cup is God s T Father I too would be baptized H Unless thou first shall hate thy Body son thou canst not love thy Self But if thou lov st thy Self thou shalt have Mind and having Mind thou shalt share in the Gnosis T Father what dost thou mean H It is not possible my son to give thyself to both I mean to things that perish and to things divine For seeing that existing things are twain Body and Bodiless in which the perishing and the divine are understood the man who hath the will to choose is left the choice of one or the other for it can never be the twain should meet And in those souls to whom the choice is left the waning of the one causes the other s growth to show itself Now the choosing of the Better not only proves a lot most fair for him who makes the choice seeing it makes the man a God but also shows his piety to God Whereas the choosing of the Worse although it doth destroy the man it doth only disturb God s harmony to this extent that as processions pass by in the middle of the way without being able to do anything but take the road from others so do such men move in procession through the world led by their bodies pleasures This being so O Tat what comes from God hath been and will be ours but that which is dependent on ourselves let this press onward and have no delay for tis not God tis we who are the cause of evil things preferring them to good Thou see st son how many are the bodies through which we have to pass how many are the choirs of daimones how vast the system of the star courses through which our Path doth lie to hasten to the One and Only God For to the Good there is no other shore It hath no bounds It is without an end and for Itself It is without beginning too though unto us it seemeth to have one the Gnosis Therefore to It Gnosis is no beginning rather is it that Gnosis doth afford to us the first beginning of its being known Let us lay hold therefore of the beginning and quickly speed through all we have to pass Tis very hard to leave the things we have grown used to which meet our gaze on every side and turn ourselves back to the Old Old Path Appearances delight us whereas things which appear not make their believing hard Now evils are the more apparent things whereas the Good can never show Itself unto the eyes for It hath neither form nor figure Therefore the Good is like Itself alone and unlike all things else or tis impossible that That which hath no body should make Itself apparent to a body The Like s superiority to the Unlike and the Unlike s inferiority unto the Like consists in this The Oneness being Source and Root of all is in all things as Root and Source Without this Source is naught whereas the Source Itself is from naught but itself since it is Source of all the rest It is Itself Its Source since It may have no other Source The Oneness then being Source containeth every number but is contained by none engendereth every number but is engendered by no other one Now all that is engendered is imperfect it is divisible to increase subject and to decrease but with the Perfect One none of these things doth hold Now that which is increasable increases from the Oneness but succumbs through its own feebleness when it no longer can contain the One And now O Tat God s Image hath been sketched for thee as far as it can be and if thou wilt attentively dwell on it and observe it with thine heart s eyes believe me son thou lt find the Path that leads above nay that Image shall become thy Guide itself because the Sight Divine hath this peculiar charm it holdeth fast and draweth unto it those who succeed in opening their eyes just as they say the magnet draweth iron I will recount to thee this sermon logos too O Tat that thou may st cease to be without the mysteries of the God beyond all name And mark thou well how that which to the many seems unmanifest will grow most manifest for thee Now were it manifest it would not be For all that is made manifest is subject to becoming for it hath been made manifest But the Unmanifest for ever is for It doth not desire to be made manifest It ever is and maketh manifest all other things Being Himself unmanifest as ever being and ever making manifest Himself is not made manifest God is not made Himself by thinking manifest He thinketh all things manifest Now thinking manifest deals with things made alone for thinking manifest is nothing else than making He then alone who is not made tis clear is both beyond all power of thinking manifest and is unmanifest And as He thinketh all things manifest He manifests through all things and in all and most of all in whatsoever things He wills to manifest Do thou then Tat my son pray first unto our Lord and Father the One and Only One from whom the One doth come to show His mercy unto thee in order that thou mayest have the power to catch a thought of this so mighty God one single beam of Him to shine into thy thinking For thought alone sees the Unmanifest in that it is itself unmanifest If then thou hast the power He will Tat manifest to thy mind s eyes The Lord begrudgeth not Himself to anything but manifests Himself through the whole world Thou hast the power of taking thought of seeing it and grasping it in thy own hands and gazing face to face upon God s Image But if what is within thee even is unmanifest to thee how then shall He Himself who is within thy self be manifest for thee by means of outer eyes But if thou wouldst see him bethink thee of the sun bethink thee of moon s course bethink thee of the order of the stars Who is the One who watcheth o er that order For every order hath its boundaries marked out by place and number The sun s the greatest god of gods in heaven to whom all of the heavenly gods give place as unto king and master And he this so great one he greater than the earth and sea endures to have above him circling smaller stars than him Out of respect to Whom or out of fear of Whom my son doth he do this Nor like nor equal is the course each of these stars describes in heaven Who then is He who marketh out the manner of their course and its extent The Bear up there that turneth round itself and carries round the whole cosmos with it Who is the owner of this instrument Who He who hath set round the sea its bounds Who He who hath set on its seat the earth For Tat there is someone who is the Maker and the Lord of all these things It cound not be that number place and measure could be kept without someone to make them No order whatsoever could be made by that which lacketh place and lacketh measure nay even this is not without a lord my son For if the orderless lacks something in that it is not lord of order s path it also is beneath a lord the one who hath not yet ordained it order Would that it were possible for thee to get thee wings and soar into the air and poised midway tween earth and heaven behold the earth s solidity the sea s fluidity the flowings of its streams the spaciousness of air fire s swiftness and the coursing of the stars the swiftness of heaven s circuit round them all Most blessed sight were it my son to see all these beneath one sway the motionless in motion and the unmanifest made manifest whereby is made this order of the cosmos and the cosmos which we see of order If thou would st see Him too through things that suffer death both on the earth and in the deep think of a man s being fashioned in the womb my son and strictly scrutinize the art of Him who fashions him and learn who fashioneth this fair and godly image of the Man Who then is He who traceth out the circles of the eyes who He who boreth out the nostrils and the ears who He who openeth the portal of the mouth who He who doth stretch out and tie the nerves who He who channels out the veins who He who hardeneth the bones who He who covereth the flesh with skin who He who separates the fingers and the joints who He who widens out a treading for the feet who He who diggeth out the ducts who He who spreadeth out the spleen who he who shapeth heart like to a pyramid who He who setteth ribs together who He who wideneth the liver out who He who maketh lungs like to a sponge who He who maketh belly stretch so much who he who doth make prominent the parts most honorable so that they may be seen while hiding out of sight those of least honor Behold how many arts employed on one material how many labors on one single sketch and all exceeding fair and all in perfect measure yet all diversified Who made them all What mother or what sire save God alone unmanifest who hath made all things by His Will And no one saith a statue or a picture comes to be without a sculptor or without a painter doth then such workmanship as this exist without a Worker What depth of blindness what deep impiety what depth of ignorance See then thou ne er son Tat deprivest works of Worker Nay rather is He greater than all names so great is He the Father of them all For verily He is the Only One and this is His work to be a father So if thou forcest me somewhat too bold to speak His being is conceiving of all things and making them And as without its maker its is impossible that anything should be so ever is He not unless He ever makes all things in heaven in air in earth in deep in all of cosmos in every part that is and that is not of everything For there is naught in all the world that is not He He is Himself both things that are and things that are not The things that are He hath made manifest He keepeth things that are not in Himself He is the God beyond all name He the unmanifest He the most manifest He whom the mind alone can contemplate He visible to the eyes as well He is the one of no body the one of many bodies nay rather He of every body Naught is there which he is not For all are He and He is all And for this cause hath He all names in that they are one Father s And for this cause hath He Himself no nome in that He s Father of them all Who then may sing Thee praise of Thee or praise to Thee Whither again am I to turn my eyes to sing Thy praise above below within without There is no way no place is there about Thee nor any other thing of things that are All are in Thee all are from Thee O Thou who givest all and takest naught for Thou hast all and naught is there Thou hast not And when O Father shall I hymn Thee For none can seize Thy hour or time For what again shall I sing hymn For things that Thou hast made or things Thou hast not For things Thou hast made manifest or things Thou hast concealed How further shall I hymn Thee As being of myself As having something of mine own As being other For that Thou art whatever I may be Thou art whatever I may do Thou art whatever I may speak For Thou art all and there is nothing else which Thou art not Thou art all that which doth exist and Thou art what doth not exist Mind when Thou thinkest and Father when Thou makest and God when Thou dost energize and Good and Maker of all things For that the subtler part of matter is the air of air the soul of soul the mind and of mind God Good O Asclepius is in none else save in God alone nay rather Good is God Himself eternally If it be so Good must be essence from every kind of motion and becoming free though naught is free from It possessed of stable energy around Itself never too little nor too much an ever full supply Though one yet is It source of all for what supplieth all is Good When I moreover say supplieth altogether all it is for ever Good But this belongs to no one else save God alone For He stands not in need of any thing so that desiring it He should be bad nor can a single thing of things that are be lost to him on losing which He should be pained for pain is part of bad Nor is there aught superior to Him that He should be subdued by it nor any peer to Him to do Him wrong or so that He should fall in love on its account nor aught that gives no ear to Him whereat He should grow angry nor wiser aught for Him to envy Now as all these are non existent in His being what is there left but Good alone For just as naught of bad is to be found in such transcendent Being so too in no one of the rest will Good be found For in them are all of the other things both in the little and the great both in each severally and in this living one that s greater than them all and the mightiest of them For things subject to birth abound in passions birth in itself being passible But where there s passion nowhere is there Good and where is Good nowhere a single passion For where is day nowhere is night and where is night day is nowhere Wherefore in genesis the Good can never be but only be in the ingenerate But seeing that the sharing in all things hath been bestowed on matter so doth it share in Good In this way is the Cosmos Good that in so far as it doth make all things as far as making goes it s Good but in all other things it is not Good For it s both passible and subject unto motion and maker of things passible Whereas in man by greater or less of bad is good determined For what is not too bad down here is good and good down here is the least part of bad It cannot therefore be that good down here should be quite clean of bad for down here good is fouled with bad and being fouled it stays no longer good and staying not it changes into bad In God alone is therefore Good or rather Good is God Himself So then Asclepius the name alone of Good is found in men the thing itself nowhere in them for this can never be For no material body doth contain It a thing bound on all sides by bad by labors pains desires and passions by error and by foolish thoughts And greatest ill of all Asclepius is that each of these things that have been said above is thought down here to be the greatest good And what is still an even greater ill is belly lust the error that doth lead the band of all the other ills the thing that makes us turn down here from Good And I for my part give thanks to God that He hath cast it in my mind about the Gnosis of the Good that it can never be It should be in the world For that the world is fullness of the bad but God of Good and Good of God The excellencies of the Beautiful are round the very essence of the Good nay they do seem too pure too unalloyed perchance tis they that are themselves Its essences For one may dare to say Asclepius if essence sooth He have God s essence is the Beautiful the Beautiful is further also Good There is no Good that can be got from objects in the world For all the things that fall beneath the eye are image things and pictures as it were while those that do not meet the eye are the realities especially the essence of the Beautiful and Good Just as the eye cannot see God so can it not behold the Beautiful and Good For that they are integral parts of God wedded to Him alone inseparate familiars most beloved with whom God is Himself in love or they with God If thou canst God conceive thou shalt conceive the Beautiful and Good transcending Light made lighter than the Light by God That Beauty is beyond compare inimitate that Good e en as God is Himself As then thou dost conceive of God conceive the Beautiful and Good For they cannot be joined with aught of other things that live since they can never be divorced from God Seek st thou for God thou seekest for the Beautiful One is the Path that leadeth unto It Devotion joined with Gnosis And thus it is that they who do not know and do not tread Devotion s Path do dare to call man beautiful and good though he have ne er e en in his visions seen a whit that s Good but is enveloped with every kind of bad and thinks the bad is good and thus doth make unceasing use of it and even feareth that it should be ta en from him so straining every nerve not only to preserve but even to increase it Such are the things that men call good and beautiful Asclepius things which we cannot flee or hate for hardest thing of all is that we ve need of them and cannot live without them Whither stumble ye sots who have sopped up the wine of ignorance and can so far not carry it that ye already even spew it forth Stay ye be sober gaze upwards with the true eyes of the heart And if ye cannot all yet ye at least who can For that the ill of ignorance doth pour o er all the earth and overwhelm the soul that s battened down within the body preventing it from fetching port within Salvation s harbors Be ye then not carried off by the fierce flood but using the shore current ye who can make for Salvation s port and harboring there seek ye for one to take you by the hand and lead you unto Gnosis gates Where shines clear Light of every darkness clean where not a single soul is drunk but sober all they gaze with their hearts eyes on Him who willeth to be seen No ear can hear Him nor can eye see Him nor tongue speak of Him but only mind and heart But first thou must tear off from thee the cloak which thou dost wear the web of ignorance the ground of bad corruption s chain the carapace of darkness the living death sensation s corpse the tomb thou carriest with thee the robber in thy house who through the things he loveth hateth thee and through the things he hateth bears thee malice Such is the hateful cloak thou wearest that throttles thee and holds thee down to it in order that thou may st not gaze above and having seen the Beauty of the Truth and Good that dwells therein detest the bad of it having found out the plot that it hath schemed against thee by making void of sense those seeming things which men think senses For that it hath with mass of matter blocked them up and crammed them full of loathsome lust so that thou may st not hear about the things that thou should st hear nor see the things thou should st see That No One of Existing Things doth Perish but Men in Error Speak of Their Changes as Destructions and as Deaths Hermes Concerning Soul and Body son we now must speak in what way Soul is deathless and whence comes the activity in composing and dissolving Body For there s no death for aught of things that are the thought this word conveys is either void of fact or simply by the knocking off a syllable what is called death doth stand for deathless For death is of destruction and nothing in the Cosmos is destroyed For if Cosmos is second God a life that cannot die it cannot be that any part of this immortal life should die All things in Cosmos are parts of Cosmos and most of all is man the rational animal For truly first of all eternal and transcending birth is God the universals Maker Second is he after His image Cosmos brought into being by Him sustained and fed by Him made deathless as by his own Sire living for aye as ever free from death Now that which ever liveth differs from the Eternal for He hath not been brought to being by another and even if He have been brought to being He hath not been brought to being by Himself but ever is brought into being For the Eternal in that It is eternal is the all The Father is Himself eternal of Himself but Cosmos hath become eternal and immortal by the Father And of the matter stored beneath it the Father made of it a universal body and packing it together made it spherical wrapping it round the life a sphere which is immortal in itself and that doth make materiality eternal But He the Father full filled with His ideas did sow the lives into the sphere and shut them in as in a cave willing to order forth the life with every kind of living So He with deathlessness enclosed the universal body that matter might not wish to separate itself from body s composition and so dissolve into its own original unorder For matter son when it was yet incorporate was in unorder And it doth still retain down here this nature of unorder enveloping the rest of the small lives that increase and decrease which men call death It is round earthly lives that this unorder doth exist For that the bodies of the heavenly ones preserve one order allotted to them by the Father as their rule and it is by the restoration of each one of them this order is preserved indissolute The restoration of bodies on the earth is thus their composition whereas their dissolution restores them to those bodies which can never be dissolved that is to say which know no death Privation thus of sense is brought about not loss of bodies Now the third life Man after the image of the Cosmos made and having mind after the Father s will beyond all earthly lives not only doth have feeling with the second God but also hath conception of the first for of the one tis sensible as of a body while of the other it conceives as bodiless and the Good Mind Tat Doth then this life not perish Hermes Hush son and understand what God what Cosmos is what is a life that cannot die and what a life subject to dissolution Yea understand the Cosmos is by God and in God but Man by Cosmos and in Cosmos The source and limit and the constitution of all things is God I gave the Perfect Sermon Logos yesterday Asclepius today I think it right as sequel thereunto to go through point by point the Sermon about Sense Now sense and thought do seem to differ in that the former has to do with matter the latter has to do with substance But unto me both seem to be at one and not to differ in men I mean In other lives sense is at oned with Nature but in men thought Now mind doth differ just as much from thought as God doth from divinity For that divinity by God doth come to be and by mind thought the sister of the word logos and instruments of one another For neither doth the word logos find utterance without thought nor is thought manifested without word So sense and thought both flow together into man as though they were entwined with one another For neither without sensing can one think nor without thinking sense But it is possible they say to think a thing apart from sense as those who fancy sights in dreams But unto me it seems that both of these activities occur in dream sight and sense doth pass out of the sleeping to the waking state For man is separated into soul and body and only when the two sides of his sense agree together does utterance of its thought conceived by mind take place For it is mind that doth conceive all thoughts good thoughts when it receives the seeds from God their contraries when it receiveth them from the daimonials no part of Cosmos being free of daimon who stealthily doth creep into the daimon who s illumined by God s light and sow in him the seed of its own energy And mind conceives the seed thus sown adultery murder parricide and sacrilege impiety and strangling casting down precipices and all such other deeds as are the work of evil daimons The seeds of God tis true are few but vast and fair and good virtue and self control devotion Devotion is God gnosis and he who knoweth God being filled with all good things thinks godly thoughts and not thoughts like the many think For this cause they who Gnostic are please not the many nor the many them They are thought mad and laughted at they re hated and despised and sometimes even put to death For we did say that bad must needs dwell on earth where tis in its own place Its place is earth and not Cosmos as some will sometimes say with impious tongue But he who is a devotee of God will bear with all once he has sensed the Gnosis For such an one all things e en though they be for others bad are for him good deliberately he doth refer them all unto the Gnosis And thing most marvelous tis he alone who maketh bad things good But I return once more to the Discourse Logos on Sense That sense doth share with thought in man doth constitute him man But tis not every man as I have said who benefits by thought for this man is material that other one substantial For the material man as I have said consorting with the bad doth have his seed of thought from daimons while the substantial men consorting with the Good are saved by God Now God is Maker of all things and in His making He maketh all at last like to Himself but they while they re becoming good by exercise of their activity are unproductive things It is the working of the Cosmic Course that maketh their becomings what they are befouling some of them with bad and others of them making clean with good For Cosmos too Asclepius possesseth sense and thought peculiar to itself not like that of man tis not so manifold but as it were a better and a simpler one The single sense and thought of Cosmos is to make all things and make them back into itself again as Organ of the Will of God so organized that it receiving all the seeds into itself from God and keeping them within itself may make all manifest and then dissolving them make them all new again and thus like a Good Gardener of Life things that have been dissolved it taketh to itself and giveth them renewal once again There is no thing to which it gives not life but taking all unto itself it makes them live and is at the same time the Place of Life and its Creator Now bodies matter made are in diversity Some are of earth of water some some are of air and some of fire But they are all composed some are more composite and some are simpler The heavier ones are more composed the lighter less so It is the speed of Cosmos Course that works the manifoldness of the kinds of births For being a most swift Breath it doth bestow their qualities on bodies together with the One Pleroma that of Life God then is Sire of Cosmos Cosmos of all in Cosmos And Cosmos is God s Son but things in Cosmos are by Cosmos And properly hath it been called Cosmos Order for that it orders all with their diversity of birth with its not leaving aught without its life with the unweariedness of its activity the speed of its necessity the composition of its elements and order of its creatures The same then of necessity and propriety should have the name of Order The sense and thought then of all lives doth come into them from without inbreathed by what contains them all whereas Cosmos receives them once for all together with its coming into being and keeps them as a gift from God But God is not as some suppose beyond the reach of sense and thought It is through superstition men thus impiously speak For all the things that are Asclepius all are in God are brought by God to be and do depend on Him both things that act through bodies and things that through soul substance make other things to move and things that make things live by means of spirit and things that take unto themselves the things that are worn out And rightly so nay I would rather say He doth not have these things but I speak forth the truth He is them all Himself He doth not get them from without but gives them out from Him This is God s sense and thought ever to move all things And never time shall be when e en a whit of things that are shall cease and when I say a whit of things that are I mean a whit of God For thigs that are God hath nor aught is there without Him nor is He without aught These things should seem to thee Asclepius if thou dost understand them true but if thou dost not understand things not to be believed To understand is to believe to not believe is not to understand My word logos doth go before thee to the truth But mighty is the mind and when it hath been led by word up to a certain point it hath the power to come before thee to the truth And having thought o er all these things and found them consonant with those which have already been translated by the reason it hath e en now believed and found its rest in that Fair Faith To those then who by God s good aid do understand the things that have been said by us above they re credible but unto those who understand them not incredible Let so much then suffice on thought and sense Hermes My yesterday s discourse logos I did devote to thee Asclepius and so tis only right I should devote toafy s to Tat and this the more because tis the abridgement of the General Sermons Logoi which he has had addressed to him God Father and the Good then Tat hath the same nature or more exactly energy For nature is a predicate of growth and used of things that change both mobile and immobile that is to say both human and divine each one of which He willeth into being But energy consists in something else as we have shown in treating of the rest both things divine and human things which thing we ought to have in mind when treating of the Good God s energy is then His Will further His essence is to will the being of all things For what is God and Father and the Good but the to be of all that are not yet Nay subsistence self of everything that is this then is God this Father this the Good to Him is added naught of all the rest And though the Cosmos that is to say the Sun is also sire himself to them that share in him yet so far is he not the cause of good unto the lives he is not even of their living So that e en if he be a sire he is entirely so by compulsion of the Good s Good will apart from which nor being nor becoming could e er be Again the parent is the children s cause both on the father s and the mother s side only by sharing in the Good s desire that doth pour through the Sun It is the Good which doeth the creating And such a power can be possessed by no one else than Him alone who taketh naught but wills all things to be I will not Tat say makes For that the maker is defective for long periods in which he sometimes makes and sometimes doth not make both in the quality and in the quantity of what he makes in that he sometimes maketh them so many and such like and sometimes the reverse But God and Father and the Good is cause for all to be So are at least these things for those who can see For It doth will to be and It is both Itself and most of all by reason of Itself Indeed all other things beside are just bacause of It for the distinctive feature of the Good is that it should be known Such is the Good O Tat Tat Thou hast O father filled us so full of this so good and fairest sight that thereby my mind s eye hath now become for me almost a thing to worship For that the vision of the Good doth not like the sun s beam firelike blaze on the eyes and make them close nay on the contrary it shineth forth and maketh to increase the seeing of the eye as far as e er a man hath the capacity to hold the inflow of the radiance that the mind alone can see Not only does it come more swiftly down to us but it does us no harm and is instinct with all immortal life They who are able to drink in a somewhat more than others of this Sight ofttimes from out the body fall asleep in this fairest Spectacle as was the case with Uranus and Cronus our forebears may this be out lot too O father mine Hermes Yea may it be my son But as it is we are not yet strung to the Vision and not as yet have we the power our mind s eye to unfold and gaze upon the Beauty of the Good Beauty that naught can e er corrupt or any comprehend For only then wilt thou upon It gaze when thou canst say no word concerning It For Gnosis of the Good is holy silence and a giving holiday to every sense For neither can he who perceiveth It perceive aught else nor he who gazeth on It gaze on aught else nor hear aught else nor stir his body any way Staying his body s every sense and every motion he stayeth still And shining then all round his mond It shines through his whole soul and draws it out of body transforming all of him to essence For it is possible my son that a man s soul should be made like to God e en while it still is in a body if it doth contemplate the Beauty of the Good Tat Made like to God What dost thou father mean Hermes Of every soul apart are transformations son Tat What meanest thou Apart Hermes Didst thou not in the General Sermons hear that from one Soul the All soul come all these souls which are made to revovlve in all the cosmos as though divided off Of these souls then it is that there are many changes some to a happier lot and some to just the contrary of this Thus some that were creeping things change into things that in the water dwell the souls of water things change to earth dwellers those that live on earth change to things with wings and souls that live in air change to men while human souls reach the first step of deathlessness changed into daimones And so they circle to the choir of the Inerrant Gods for of the Gods there are two choirs the one Inerrant and the other Errant And this is the most perfect glory of the soul But if a soul on entering the body of a man persisteth in its vice it neither tasteth deathlessness nor shareth in the Good but speeding back again it turns into the path that leads to creeping things This is the sentence of the vicious soul And the soul s vice is ignorance For that the soul who hath no knowledge of the things that are or knowledge of their nature or of Good is blinded by the body s passions and tossed about This wretched soul not knowing what she is becomes the slave of bodies of strange form in sorry plight bearing the body as a load not as the ruler but the ruled This ignorance is the soul s vice But on the other hand the virtue of the soul is Gnosis For he who knows he good and pious is and still while on the earth divine Tat But who is such an one O father mine Hermes He who doth not say much or lend his ear to much For he who spendeth time in arguing and hearing arguments doth shadow fight For God the Father and the Good is not to be obtained by speech or hearing And yet though this is so there are in all the beings senses in that they cannot without senses be But Gnosis is far different from sense For sense is brought about by that which hath the mastery o er us while Gnosis is the end of science and science is God s gift All science is incorporeal the instrument it uses being the mind just as the mind employs the body Both then come into bodies I mean both things that are cognizable by mond alone and things material For all things must consist out of antithesis and contrariety and this can otherwise not be Tat Who then is this material God of whom thou speakest Hermes Cosmos is beautiful but is not good for that it is material and freely passible and though it is the first of all things passible yet is it in the second rank of being and wanting in itself And though it never hath itself its birth in time but ever is yet is its being in becoming becoming for all time the genesis of qualities and quantities for it is mobile and all material motion s genesis It is intelligible rest that moves material motion in this way since Cosmos is a sphere that is to say a head And naught of head above s material as naught of feet below s intelligible but all material And head itself is moved in a sphere like way that is to say as head should move is mind All then that are united to the tissue of this head in which is soul are in their nature free from death just as when body hath been made in soul are things that hath more soul than body Whereas those things which are at greater distance from this tissue there where are things which have a greater share of body than of soul are by their nature subject unto death The whole however is a life so that the universe consists of both the hylic and of the intelligible Again the Cosmos is the first of living things while man is second after it though first of things subject to death Man hath the same ensouling power in him as all the rest of living things yet is he not only not good but even evil for that he s subject unto death For though the Cosmos also is not good in that it suffers motion it is not evil in that it is not subject to death But man in that he s subject both to motion and to death is evil Now then the principles of man are this wise vehicled mind in the reason logos the reason in the soul soul in the spirit and spirit in the body Spirit pervading body by means of veins and arteries and blood bestows upon the living creature motion and as it were doth bear it in a way For this cause some do think the soul is blood in that they do mistake its nature not knowing that at death it is iteh spirit that must first withdraw into the soul whereon the blood congeals and veins and arteries are emptied and then the living creature is withdrawn and this is body s death Now from one Source all things depend while Source dependeth from the One and Only One Source is moreover moved to become Source again whereas the One standeth perpetually and is not moved Three then are they God the Father and the Good Cosmos and man God doth contain Cosmos Cosmos containeth man Cosmos is e er God s Son man as it were Cosmos child Not that however God ignoreth man nay right well doth He know him and willeth to be known This is the sole salvation for a man God s Gnosis This is the Way Up to the Mount By Him alone the soul becometh good not whiles is good whiles evil but good out of necessity Tat What dost thou mean Thrice greatest one Hermes Behold an infant s soul my son that is not yet cut off because its body is still small and not as yet come unto its full bulk Tat How Hermes A thing of beauty altogether is such a soul to see not yet befouled by body s passions still all but hanging from the Cosmic Soul But when the body grows in bulk and draweth down the soul into its mass then doth the soul cut off itself and bring upon itself forgetfulness and no more shareth in the Beautiful and the Good And this forgetfulness becometh vice It is the same for them who go out from the body For when the soul withdraws into itself the spirit doth contract itself within the blood and the soul within the spirit And then the mind stripped of its wrappings and naturally divine taking unto itself a fiery body doth traverse every space after abandoning the soul unto its judgement and whatever chastisement it hath deserved Tat What dost thou father mean by this The mind is parted from soul and soul from spirit Whereas thou said st the soul was the mind s vesture and the soul s the spirit Hermes The hearer son should think with him who speaks and breathe with him nay he should have a hearing subtler than the voice of him who speaks It is son in a body made of earth that this arrangement of the vestures comes to pass For in a body made of earth it is impossible the mind should take its seat itself by its own self in nakedness For neither is it possible on the one hand the earthly body should contain so much immortality nor on the other that so great a virtue should endure a body passible in such close contact with it It taketh then the soul for as it were an envelope And soul itself being too and thing divine doth use the spirit as its envelope while spirit doth pervade the living creature When then the mind doth free itself from the earth body it straightway putteth on its proper robe of fire with which it could not dwell in an earth body For earth doth not bear fire for it is all set in a blaze even by a small spark And for this cause is water poured around earth to be a guard and wall to keep the blazing of the fire away But mind the swiftest thing of all divine outthinkings and swifter than all elements hath for its body fire For mind being builder doth use the fire as tool for the construction of all things the Mind of all for the construction of all things but that of man only for things on earth Stript of its fire the mind on earth cannot make things divine for it is human in its dispensation The soul in man however not every soul but one that pious is is a daimonic something and divine And such a soul when from the body freed if it have fought the fight of piety the fight of piety is to know God and to do wrong to no man such a soul becomes entirely mind Whereas the impious soul remains in its own essence chastised by its own self and seeking for an earthly body where to enter if only it be human For that no other body can contain a human soul nor is it right that any human soul should fall into the body of a thing that doth possess no reason For that the law of God is this to guard the human soul from such tremendous outrage Tat How father then is a man s soul chastised Hermes What greater chastisement of any human soul can there be son than lack of piety What fire has so fierce a flame as lack of piety What ravenous beast so mauls the body as lack of piety the very soul Dost thou not see what hosts of ills the impious soul doth bear It shrieks and screams I burn I am ablaze I know not what to cry or do ah wretched me I am devoured by all the ills that compass me about alack poor me I neither see nor hear Such are the cries wrung from a soul chastised not as the many think and thou son dost suppose that a man s soul passing from body is changed into a beast Such is a very grave mistake for that the way a soul doth suffer chastisement is this When mind becomes a daimon the law requires that it should take a fiery body to execute the services of God and entering in the soul most impious it scourgeth it with whips made of its sins And then the impious soul scourged with its sins is plunged in murders outrage blasphemy in violence of all kinds and all the other things whereby mankind is wronged But on the pious soul the mind doth mount and guide it to the Gnosis Light And such a soul doth never tire in songs of praise to God and pouring blessing on all men and doing good in word and deed to all in imitation of its Sire Wherefore my son thou shouldst give praise to God and pray that thou mayst have thy mind Good Mind It is then to a better state the soul doth pass it cannot to a worse Further there is an intercourse of souls those of the gods have intercourse with those of men and those of men with souls of creatures which possess no reason The higher further have in charge the lower the gods look after men men after animals irrational while God hath charge of all for He is higher than them all and all are less than He Cosmos is subject then to God man to the Cosmos and irrationals to man But God is o er them all and God contains them all God s rays to use a figure are His energies the Cosmos s are natures the arts and sciences are man s The energies act through the Cosmos thence through the nature rays of Cosmos upon man the nature rays act through the elements man acteth through the sciences and arts This is the dispensation of the universe depending from the nature of the One pervading all things through the Mind than which is naught diviner nor of greater energy and naught a greater means for the at oning men to gods and gods to men He Mind is the Good Daimon Blessed the soul that is most filled with Him and wretched is the soul that s empty of the Mind Tat Father what dost thou mean again Hermes Dost think then son that every soul hath the Good Mind For tis of Him we speak not of the mind in service of which we were just speaking the mind sent down for the soul s chastisement For soul without the mind can neither speak nor act For oftentimes the mind doth leave the soul and at that time the soul neither sees nor understands but is just like a thing that hath no reason Such is the power of mind Yet doth it not endure a sluggish soul but leaveth such a soul tied to the body and bound tight down by it Such soul my son doth not have Mind and therefore such an one should not be called a man For that man is a thing of life divine man is not measured with the rest of lives of things upon the earth but with the lives above in heaven who are called gods Nay more if we must boldly speak the truth the true man is e en higher than the gods or at the very least the gods and men are very whit in power each with the other equal For no one of the gods in heaven shall come down to the earth o er stepping heaven s limit whereas man doth mount up to heaven and measure it he knows what things of it are high what things are low and learns precisely all things else besides And greater thing than all without e en quitting earth he doth ascend above So vast a sweep doth he possess of ecstasy For this cause can a man dare say that man on earth is god subject to death while god in heaven is man from death immune Wherefore the dispensation of all things is brought about by means of there the twain Cosmos and Man but by the One Mind Master this sermon logos then Thrice greatest Hermes and bear in mind the spoken words and as it hath come unto Me to speak I will no more delay Hermes As many men say many things and these diverse about the All and Good I have not learned the truth Make it then clear to me O Master mine For I can trust the explanation of these things which comes from Thee alone Mind Hear then My son how standeth God and All God Aeon Cosmos Time Becoming God maketh Aeon Aeon Cosmos Cosmos Time and Time Becoming The Good the Beautiful Wisdom Blessedness is essence as it were of God of Aeon Sameness of Cosmos Order of Time Change and of Becoming Life and Death The energies of God are Mind and Soul of Aeon lastingness and deathlessness of Cosmos restoration and the opposite thereof of Time increase and decrease and of Becoming quality Aeon is then in God Cosmos in Aeon in Cosmos Time in Time Becoming Aeon stands firm round God Cosmos is moved in Aeon Time hath its limits in the Cosmos Becoming doth become in Time The source therfore of all is God their essence Aeon their matter Cosmos God s power is Aeon Aeon s work is Cosmos which never hath become yet ever doth become by Aeon Therefore will Cosmos never be destroyed for Aeon s indestructible nor doth a whit of things in Cosmos perish for Cosmos is enwrapped by Aeon round on every side Hermes But God s Wisdom what is that Mind The Good and Beautiful and Blessedness and Virtue s all and Aeon Aeon then ordereth Cosmos imparting deathlessness and lastingness to matter For its beginning doth depend on Aeon as Aeon doth on God Now Genesis and Time in Heaven and upon the Earth are of two natures In Heaven they are unchangeable and indestructible but on the Earth they re subject unto change and to destruction Further the Aeon s soul is God the Cosmos soul is Aeon the Earth s soul Heaven And God in Mind and Mind in Soul and Soul in Matter and all of them through Aeon But all this Body in which are all the bodies is full of Soul and Soul is full of Mind and Mind of God It fills it from within and from without encircles it making the All to live Without this vast and perfect Life encircles Cosmos within it fills it with all lives above in Heaven continuing in sameness below on Earth changing becoming And Aeon doth preserve this Cosmos or by Necessity or by Foreknowledge or by Nature or by whatever else a man supposes or shall suppose And all is this God energizing The Energy of God is Power that naught can e er surpass a Power with which no one can make comparison of any human thing at all or any thing divine Wherefore O Hermes never think that aught of things above or things below is like to God for thou wilt fall from truth For naught is like to That which hath no like and is Alone and One And do not ever think that any other can possibly possess His power for what apart from Him is there of life and deathlessness and change of quality For what else should He make God s not inactive since all things then would lack activity for all are full of God But neither in the Cosmos anywhere nor in aught else is there inaction For that inaction is a name that cannot be applied to either what doth make or what is made But all things must be made both ever made and also in accordance with the influence of every space For He who makes is in them all not stablished in some one of them nor making one thing only but making all For being Power He energizeth in the things He makes and is not independent of them although the things He makes are subject to Him Now gaze through Me upon the Cosmos that s now subject to thy sight regard its Beauty carefully Body in pure perfection though one than which there s no more ancient one ever in prime of life and ever young nay rather in even fuller and yet fuller prime Behold again the seven subject Worlds ordered by Aeon s order and with their varied course full filling Aeon See how all things are full of light and nowhere is there fire for tis the love and the blending of the contraries and the dissimilars that doth give birth to light down shining by the energy of God the Father of all good the Leader of all order and Ruler of the seven world orderings Behold the Moon forerunner of them all the instrument of nature and the transmuter of its lower matter Look at the Earth set in the midst of All foundation of the Cosmos Beautiful feeder and nurse of things on Earth And contemplate the multitude of deathless lives how great it is and that of lives subject to death and midway between both immortal lives and mortal see thou the circling Moon And all are full of soul and all are moved by it each in its proper way some round the Heaven others around the Earth see how the right move not unto the left nor yet the left unto the right nor the above below nor the below above And that all there are subject unto Genesis My dearest Hermes thou hast no longer need to learn of Me For that they bodies are have souls and they are moved But tis impossible for them to come together into one without some one to bring them all together It must then be that such a one as this must be some one who s wholly One For as the many motions of them all are different and as their bodies are not like yet has one speed been ordered for them all it is impossible that there should be two or more makers for them For that one single order is not kept among the many but rivalry will follow of the weaker with the stronger and they will strive And if the maker of the lives that suffer change and death should be another he would desire to make the deathless ones as well just as the maker of the deathless ones to make the lives that suffer death But come if there be two if matter s one and Soul is one in whose hands would there be the distribution for the making Again if both of them have some of it in whose hands may be the greater part But thus conceive it then that every living body doth consist of soul and matter whether that body be of an immortal or a mortal or an irrational life For that all living bodies are ensouled whereas upon the other hand those that live not are matter by itself And in like fashion Soul when in its self is after its own maker cause of life but the cause of all life is He who makes the things that cannot die Hermes How then is it that first lives subject to death are other than the deathless ones And next how is it that Life which knows no death and maketh deathlessness doth not make animals immortal Mind First that there is some one who does these things is clear and next that He is also One is very manifest For also Soul is one and Life is one and Matter one Hermes But who is He Mind Who may it other be than the One God Whom else should it beseem to put Soul into lives but God alone One then is God It would indeed be most ridiculous if when thou dost confess the Cosmos to be one Sun one Moon one and Godhead one thou shouldst wish God Himself to be some one or other of a number All things therefore He makes in many ways And what great thing is it for God to make life soul and deathlessness and change when thou thyself dost do so many things For thou dost see and speak and hear and smell and taste and touch and walk and think and breathe And it is not one man who smells another one who walks another one who thinks and yet another one who breathes But one is he who doth all these And yet no one of these could be apart from God For just as should thou cease from these thou wouldst no longer be a living thing so also should God cease from them a thing not law to say no longer is He God For if it hath been shown that no thing can inactive be how much less God For if there s aught he doth not make if it be law to say He is imperfect But if He is not only not inactive but perfect God then He doth make all things Give thou thyself to Me My Hermes for a little while and thou shalt understand more easily how that God s work is one in order that all things may be that are being made or once have been or that are going to be made And this is My beloved Life this is the Beautiful this is the Good this God And if thou wouldst in practice understand this work behold what taketh place with thee desiring to beget Yet this is not like unto that for He doth not enjoy For that indeed He hath no other one to share in what He works for working by Himself He ever is at work Himself being what He doth For did He separate Himself from it all things would then collapse and all must die Life ceasing But if all things are lives and also Life is one then one is God And furthermore if all are lives both those in Heaven and those on Earth and One Life in them all is made to be by God and God is it then all are made by God Life is the making one of Mind and Soul accordingly Death is not the destruction of those that are at oned but the dissolving of their union Aeon moreover is God s image Cosmos is Aeon s the Sun of Cosmos and Man the image of the Sun The people call change death because the body is dissolved and life when it s dissolved withdraws to the unmanifest But in this sermon logos Hermes My beloved as thou dost hear I say the Cosmos also suffers change for that a part of it each day is made to be in the unmanifest yet it is ne er dissolved These are the passions of the Cosmos revolvings and concealments revolving is conversion and concealment renovation The Cosmos is all formed not having forms external to itself but changing them itself within itself Since then Cosmos is made to be all formed what may its maker be For that on the one hand He should not be void of all form and on the other hand if He s all formed He will be like the Cosmos Whereas again has He a single form He will thereby be less than Cosmos What then say we He is that we may not bring round our sermon logos into doubt for naught that mind conceives of God is doubtful He then hath one idea which is His own alone which doth not fall beneath the sight being bodiless and yet by means of bodies manifesteth all ideas And marvel not that there s a bodiless idea For it is like the form of reason logos and mountain tops in pictures For they appear to stand out strongly from the rest but really are quite smooth and flat And now consider what is said more boldly but more truly Just as man cannot live apart from Life so neither can God live without His doing good For this is as it were the life and motion as it were of God to move all things and make them live Now some of the things said should bear a sense peculiar to themselves So understand for instance what I'm going to say All are in God but not as lying in a place For place is both a body and immovable and things that lie do not have motion Now things lie one way in the bodiless another way in being made manifest Think then of Him who doth contain them all and think that than the bodiless naught is more comprehensive or swifter or more potent but it is the most comprehensive the swiftest and most potent of them all And thus think from thyself and bid thy soul go unto any land and there more quickly than thy bidding will it be And bid it journey oceanwards and there again immediately twill be not as if passing on from place to place but as if being there And bid it also mount to heaven and it will need no wings not will aught hinder it nor fire of sun nor auther nor vortex swirl nor bodies of the other stars but cutting through them all it will soar up to the last Body of them all And shouldst thou will to break through this as well and contemplate what is beyond if there be aught beyond the Cosmos it is permitted thee Behold what power what swiftness thou dost have And canst thou do all of these things and God not do them Then in this way know God as having all things in Himself as thoughts the whole Cosmos itself If then thou dost not make thyself like unto God thou canst not know Him For like is knowable unto like alone Make then thyself to grow to the same stature as the Greatness which transcends all measure leap forth from every body transcend all time become Eternity and thus shalt thou know God Conceiving nothing is impossible unto thyself think thyself deathless and able to know all all arts all sciences the way of every life Become more lofty than all height and lower than all depth Collect into thyself all senses of all creatures of fire and water dry and moist Think that thou art at the same time in every place in earth in sea in sky not yet begotten in the womb young old and dead in after death conditions And if thou knowest all these things at once times places doings qualities and quantities thou canst know God But if thou lockest up thy soul within thy body and dost debase it saying I nothing know I nothing can I fear the sea I cannot scale the sky I know not who I was who I shall be what is there then between thy God and thee For thou canst know naught of things beautiful and good so long as thou dost love thy body and art bad The greatest bad there is is not to know God s Good but to be able to know Good and will and hope is a Straight Way the Good s own Path both leading there and easy If thou but settest thy foot thereon twill meet thee everywhere twill everywhere be seen both where and when thou dost expect it not waking sleeping sailing journeying by night by day speaking and saying naught For there is naught that is not image of the Good Hermes Is God unseen Mind Hush Who is more manifest than He For this one reason hath He made all things that through them all thou mayest see Him This is the Good of God this is His Virtue that He may be manifest through all For naught s unseen even of things that are without a body Mind sees itself in thinking God in making So far these things have been made manifest to thee Thrice greatest one Reflect on all the rest in the same way with thyself and thou shalt not be led astray Hermes The Mind O Tat is of God s very essence if such a thing as essence of God there be and what that is it and it only knows precisely The Mind then is not separated off from God s essentiality but is united to it as light to sun This Mind in men is God and for this cause some of mankind are gods and their humanity is nigh unto divinity For the Good Daimon said Gods are immortal men and men are mortal gods But in irrational lives Mind is their nature For where is Soul there too is Mind just as where Life there is there also Soul But in irrational lives their soul is life devoid of mind for Mind is the in worker of the souls of men for good He works on them for their own good In lives irrational He doth co operate with each one s nature but in the souls of men He counteracteth them For every soul when it becomes embodied is instantly depraved by pleasure and by pain For in a compound body just like juices pain and pleasure seethe and into them the soul on entering in is plunged O er whatsoever souls the Mind doth then preside to these it showeth its own light by acting counter to their prepossessions just as a good physician doth upon the body prepossessed by sickness pain inflict burning or lancing it for sake of health In just the selfsame way the Mind inflicteth pain on the soul to rescue it from pleasure whence comes its every ill The great ill of the soul is godlessness then followeth fancy for all evil things and nothing good So then Mind counteracting it doth work good on the soul as the physician health upon the body But whatsoever human souls have not the Mind as pilot they share in the same fate as souls of lives irrational For Mind becomes co worker with them giving full play to the desires toward which such souls are borne desires that from the rush of lust strain after the irrational so that such human souls just like irrational animals cease not irrationally to rage and lust nor are they ever satiate of ills For passions and irrational desires are ills exceeding great and over these God hath set up the Mind to play the part of judge and executioner Tat In that case father mine the teaching logos as to Fate which previously thou didst explain to me risks to be overset For that if it be absolutely fated for a man to fornicate or commit sacrilege or do some other evil deed why is he punished when he hath done the deed from Fate s necessity Hermes All works my son are Fate s and without Fate naught of things corporal or good or ill can come to pass But it is fated too that he who doeth ill shall suffer And for this cause he doth it that he may suffer what he suffereth because he did it But for the moment Tat let be the teaching as to vice and Fate for we have spoken of these things in other of our sermons but now our teaching logos is about the Mind what Mind can do and how it is so different in men being such and such and in irrational lives so changed and then again that in irrational lives it is not of a beneficial nature while that in men it quencheth out the wrathful and the lustful elements Of men again we must class some as led by reason and others as unreasoning But all men are subject to Fate and genesis and change for these are the beginning and the end of Fate And though all men do suffer fated things those led by reason those whom we said Mind doth guide do not endure like suffering with the rest but since they ve freed themselves from viciousness not being bad they do not suffer bad Tat How meanest thou again my father Is not the fornicator bad the murderer bad and so with all the rest Hermes I meant not that but that the Mind led man my son though not a fornicator will suffer just as though he had committed fornication and though he be no murderer as though he had committed murder The quality of change he can no more escape than that of genesis But it is possible for one who hath the Mind to free himself from vice Wherefore I ve ever heard my son Good Daimon also say and had He set it down in written words He would have greatly helped the race of men for He alone my son doth truly as the Firstborn God gazing on all things give voice to words logoi divine yea once I heard Him say All things are one and most of all the bodies which the mind alone perceives Our life is owing to God s Energy and Power and Aeon His Mind is good so is His Soul as well And this being so intelligible things know naught of separation So then Mind being Ruler of all things and being Soul of God can do whate er it wills So do thou understand and carry back this word logos unto the question thou didst ask before I mean about Mind s Fate For if thou dost with accuracy son eliminate all captious arguments logoi thou wilt discover that of very truth the Mind the Soul of God doth rule o er all o er Fate and Law and all things else and nothing is impossible to it neither o er Fate to set a human soul nor under Fate to set a soul neglectful of what comes to pass Let this so far suffice from the Good Daimon s most good words Tat Yea words divinely spoken father mine truly and helpfully But further still explain me this Thou said st that Mind in lives irrational worked in them as their nature co working with their impulses But impulses of lives irrational as I do think are passions Now if the Mind co worketh with these impulses and if the impulses of lives irrational be passions then is Mind also passion taking its color from the passions Hermes Well put my son Thou questionest right nobly and it is just that I as well should answer nobly All things incorporeal when in a body are subject unto passion and in the proper sense they are themselves all passions For every thing that moves itself is incorporeal while every thing that s moved is body Incorporeals are further moved by Mind and movement s passion Both then are subject unto passion both mover and the moved the former being ruler and the latter ruled But when a man hath freed himself from body then is he also freed from passion But more precisely son naught is impassible but all are passible Yet passion differeth from passibility for that the one is active while the other s passive Incorporeals moreover act upon themselves for either they are motionless or they are moved but whichsoe er it be it s passion But bodies are invaribly acted on and therefore they are passible Do not then let terms trouble thee action and passion are both the selfsame thing To use the fairer sounding term however does no harm Tat Most clearly hast thou father mine set forth the teaching logos Hermes Consider this as well my son that these two things God hath bestowed on man beyond all mortal lives both mind and speech logos equal to immortality He hath the mind for knowing God and uttered speech logos for eulogy of Him And if one useth these for what he ought he ll differ not a whit from the immortals Nay rather on departing from the body he will be guided by the twain unto the Choir of Gods and Blessed Ones Tat Why father mine do not the other lives make use of speech logos Hermes Nay son but use of voice speech is far different from voice For speech is general among all men while voice doth differ in each class of living thing Tat But with men also father mine according to each race speech differs Hermes Yea son but man is one so also speech is one and is interpreted and it is found the same in Egypt and in Persia and in Greece Thou seemest son to be in ignorance of Reason s Logos worth and greatness For that the Blessed God Good Daimon hath declared Soul is in Body Mind in Soul but Reason Logos is in Mind and Mind in God and God is Father of all these The Reason then is the Mind s image and Mind God s image while Body is the image of the Form and Form the image of the Soul The subtlest part of Matter is then Air of Air Soul of Soul Mind and of Mind God And God surroundeth all and permeateth all while Mind Surroundeth Soul Soul Air Air Matter Necessity and Providence and Nature are instruments of Cosmos and of Matter s ordering while of intelligible things each is Essence and Sameness is their Essence But of the bodies of the Cosmos each is many for through possessiong Sameness these composed bodies though they do change from one into another of themselves do natheless keep the incorruption of their Sameness Whereas in all the rest of composed bodies of each there is a certain number for without number structure cannot be or composition or decomposition Now it is units that give birth to number and increase it and being decomposed are taken back again into themselves Matter is one and this whole Cosmos the mighty God and image of the mightier One both with Him unified and the conserver of the Will and Order of the Father is filled full of Life Naught is there in it throughout the whole of Aeon the Father s everlasting Re establishment nor of the whole nor of the parts which doth not live For not a single thing that s dead hath been or is or shall be in this Cosmos For that the Father willed it should have Life as long as it should be Wherefore it needs must be a God How then O son could there be in the God the image of the Father in the plenitude of Life dead things For that death is corruption and corruption destruction How then could any part of that which knoweth no corruption be corrupted or any whit of him the God destroyed Tat Do they not then my father die the lives in it that are its parts Hermes Hush son led into error by the term in use for what takes place They do not die my son but are dissolved as compound bodies Now dissolution is not death but dissolution of a compound it is dissolved not so that it may be destroyed but that it may become renewed For what is the activity of life Is it not motion What then in Cosmos is there that hath no motion Naught is there son Tat Doth not Earth even father seem to thee to have no motion Hermes Nay son but rather that she is the only thing which though in very rapid motion is also stable For how would it not be a thing to laugh at that the Nurse of all should have no motion when she engenders and brings forth all things For tis impossible that without motion one who doth engender should do so That thou should ask if the fourth part is not inert is most ridiculous for the body which doth have no motion gives sign of nothing but inertia Know therefore generally my son that all that is in Cosmos is being moved for increase or for decrease Now that which is kept moving also lives but there is no necessity that that which lives should be all same For being simultaneous the Cosmos as a whole is not subject to change my son but all its parts are subject unto it yet naught of it is subject to corruption or destroyed It is the terms employed that confuse men For tis not genesis that constituteth life but tis sensation it is not change that constituteth death but tis forgetfulness Since then these things are so they are immortal all Matter and Life and Spirit Mind and Soul of which whatever liveth is composed Whatever then doth live oweth its immortality unto the Mind and most of all doth man he who is both recipient of God and co essential with Him For with this life alone doth God consort by visions in the night by tokens in the day and by all things doth He foretell the future unto him by birds by inward parts by wind by tree Wherefore doth man lay claim to know things past things present and to come Observe this too my son that each one of the other lives inhabiteth one portion of the Cosmos aquatic creatures water terrene earth and aery creatures air while man doth use all these earth water air and fire he seeth Heaven too and doth contact it with his sense But God surroundeth all and permeateth all for He is energy and power and it is nothing difficult my son to conceive God But if thou wouldst Him also contemplate behold the ordering of the Cosmos and see the orderly behavior of its ordering behold thou the Necessity of things made manifest and see the Providence of things become and things becoming behold how Matter is all full of Life behold this so great God in movement with all the good and noble ones gods daimones and men Tat But these are purely energies O father mine Hermes If then they re purely energies my son by whom then are they energized except by God Or art thou ignorant that just as Heaven Earth Water Air are parts of Cosmos in just the selfsame way God s parts are Life and Immortality and Energy and Spirit and Necessity and Providence and Nature Soul and Mind and the Duration of all these that is called Good And there are naught of things that have become or are becoming in which God is not Tat Is He in Matter father then Hermes Matter my son is separate from God in order that thou may st attribute to it the quality of space But what thing else than mass think st thou it is if it s not energized Whereas if it be energized by whom is it made so For energies we said are parts of God By whom are then all lives enlivened By whom are things immortal made immortal By whom changed things made changeable And whether thou dost speak of Matter of Body or of Essence know that these too are energies of God and that materiality is Matter s energy that corporeality is Bodies energy and that essentiality doth constituteth the energy of Essence and this is God the All And in the All is naught that is not God Wherefore nor size nor space nor quality nor form nor time surroundeth God for He is All and All surroundeth all and permeateth all Unto this Reason Logos son thy adoration and thy worship pay There is one way alone to worship God it is not to be bad Tat Now in the General Sermons father thou didst speak in riddles most unclear conversing on Divinity and when thou saidst no man could e er be saved before Rebirth thy meaning thou didst hide Further when I became thy Suppliant in Wending up the Mount after thou hadst conversed with me and when I longed to learn the Sermon Logos on Rebirth for this beyond all other things is just the thing I know not thou saidst that thou wouldst give it me when thou shalt have become a stranger to the world Wherefore I got me ready and made the thought in me a stranger to the world illusion And now do thou fill up the things that fall short in me with what thou saidst would give me the tradition of Rebirth setting it forth in speech or in the secret way I know not O Thrice greatest one from out what matter and what womb Man comes to birth or of what seed Hermes Wisdom that understands in silence such is the matter and the womb from out which Man is born and the True Good the seed Tat Who is the sower father For I am altogether at a loss Hermes It is the Will of God my son Tat And of what kind is he that is begotten father For I have no share of that essence in me which doth transcend the senses The one that is begot will be another one from God God s Son Hermes All in all out of all powers composed Tat Thou tellest me a riddle father and dost not speak as father unto son Hermes This Race my son is never taught but when He willeth it its memory is restored by God Tat Thou sayest things impossible O father things that are forced Hence answers would I have direct unto these things Am I a son strange to my father s race Keep it not father back from me I am a true born son explain to me the manner of Rebirth Hermes What may I say my son I can but tell thee this Whene er I see within myself the Simple Vision brought to birth out of God s mercy I have passed through myself into a Body that can never die And now i am not as I was before but I am born in Mind The way to do this is not taught and it cannot be seen by the compounded element by means of which thou seest Yea I have had my former composed form dismembered for me I am no longer touched but I have touch I have dimension too and yet am I a stranger to them now Thou seest me with eyes my son but what I am thou dost not understand even with fullest strain of body and of sight Tat Into fierce frenzy and mind fury hast thou plunged me father for now no longer do I see myself Hermes I would my son that thou hadst e en passed right through thyself as they who dream in sleep yet sleepless Tat Tell me this too Who is the author of Rebirth Hermes The Son of God the One Man by God s Will Tat Now hast thou brought me father unto pure stupefaction Arrested from the senses which I had before for now I see thy Greatness identical with thy distinctive form Hermes Even in this thou art untrue the mortal form doth change with every day Tis turned by time to growth and waning as being an untrue thing Tat What then is true Thrice greatest One Hermes That which is never troubled son which cannot be defined that which no color hath nor any figure which is not turned which hath no garment which giveth light that which is comprehensible unto itself alone which doth not suffer change that which no body can contain Tat In very truth I lose my reason father Just when I thought to be made wise by thee I find the senses of this mind of mine blocked up Hermes Thus is it son That which is upward borne like fire yet is borne down like earth that which is moist like water yet blows like air how shalt thou this perceive with sense the that which is not solid nor yet moist which naught can bind or loose of which in power and energy alone can man have any notion and even then it wants a man who can perceive the Way of Birth in God Tat I am incapable of this O father then Hermes Nay God forbid my son Withdraw into thyself and it will come will and it comes to pass throw out of work the body s senses and thy Divinity shall come to birth purge from thyself the brutish torments things of matter Tat I have tormentors then in me O father Hermes Ay no few my son nay fearful ones and manifold Tat I do not know them father Hermes Torment the first is this Not knowing son the second one is Grief the third Intemperance the fourth Concupiscence the fifth Unrighteousness the sixth is Avarice the seventh Error the eighth is Envy the ninth Guile the tenth is Anger eleventh Rashness the twelfth is Malice These are in number twelve but under them are many more my son and creeping through the prison of the body they force the man that s placed therein to suffer in his senses But they depart though not all at once from him who hath been taken pity on by God and this it is which constitutes the manner of Rebirth And the Reason Logos And now my son be still and solemn silence keep Thus shall the mercy that flows on us from God not cease Henceforth rejoice O son for by the Powers of God thou art being purified for the articulation of the Reason Logos Gnosis of God hath come to us and when this comes my son Not knowing is cast out Gnosis of Joy hath come to us and on its coming son Sorrow will flee away to them who give it room The Power that follows Joy do I invoke thy Self control O Power most sweet Let us most gladly bid it welcome son How with its coming doth it chase Intemperance away Now fourth on Continence I call the Power against Desire This step my son is Righteousness firm seat For without judgement see how she hath chased Unrighteousness away We are made righteous son by the departure of Unrighteousness Power sixth I call to us that against Avarice Sharing with all And now that Avarice is gone I call on Truth And Error flees and Truth is with us See how the measure of the Good is full my son upon Truth s coming For Envy is gone from us and unto Truth is joined the Good as well with Life and Light And now no more doth any torment of the Darkness venture nigh but vanquished all have fled with whirring wings Thou knowest now my son the manner of Rebirth And when the Ten is come my son that driveth out the Twelve the Birth in understanding is complete and by this birth we are made into Gods Who then doth by His mercy gain this Birth in God abandoning the body s senses knows himself to be of Light and Life and that he doth consist of these and thus is filled with bliss Tat By God made steadfast father no longer with the sight my eyes afford I look on things but with the energy the Mind doth give me through the Powers In Heaven am I in earth in water air I am in animals in plants I'm in the womb before the womb after the womb I'm everywhere But further tell me this How are the torments of the Darkness when they are twelve in number driven out by the ten Powers What is the way of it Thrice greatest one Hermes This dwelling place through which we have just passed my son is constituted from the circle of the twelve types of life this being composed of elements twelve in number but of one nature an omniform idea For man s delusion there are disunions in them son while in their action they are one Not only can we never part Rashness from Wrath they cannot even be distinguished According to right reason logos then they naturally withdraw once and for all in as much as they are chased out by no less than ten powers that is the Ten For son the Ten is that which giveth birth to souls And Life and Light are unified there where the One hath being from the Spirit According then to reason logos the One contains the Ten the Ten the One Tat Father I see the All I see myself in Mind Hermes This is my son Rebirth no more to look on things from body s view point a thing three ways in space extended though this Sermon Logos on Rebirth on which I did not comment in order that we may not be calumniators of the All unto the multitude to whom indeed God Himself doth will we should not Tat Tell me O father This Body which is made up of the Powers is it at any time dissolved Hermes Hush son Speak not of things impossible else wilt thou sin and thy Mind s eye be quenched The natural body which our sense perceives is far removed from this essential birth The first must be dissolved the last can never be the first must die the last death cannot touch Dost thou not know thou hast been born a God Son of the One even as I myself Tat I would O father hear the Praise giving with hymn which thou didst say thou heardest then when thou wert at the Eight the Ogdoad of Powers Hermes Just as the Shepherd did foretell I should my son when I came to the Eight Well dost thou haste to strike thy tent for thou hast been made pure The Shepherd Mind of all masterhood hath not passed on to me more than hath been written down for full well did he know that I should of myself be able to learn all and hear what I should wish and see all things He left to me the making of fair things wherefore the Powers within me e en as they are in all break into song Tat Father I wish to hear I long to know these things Hermes Be still my son hear the Praise giving now that keeps the soul in tune Hymn of Re birth a hymn I would not have thought fit so readily to tell had st thou not reached the end of all Wherefore this is not taught but is kept hid in silence Thus then my son stand in a place uncovered to the sky facing the southern wind about the sinking of the setting sun and make thy worship so in like manner too when he doth rise with face to the east wind Now son be still The Secret Hymnody Let every nature of the World receive the utterance of my hymn Open thou Earth Let every bolt of the Abyss be drawn for me Stir not ye Trees I am about to hymn creation s Lord both All and One Ye Heavens open and ye Winds stay still and let God s deathless Sphere receive my word logos For I will sing the praise of Him who founded all who fixed the Earth and hung up Heaven and gave command that Ocean should afford sweet water to the Earth to both those parts that are inhabited and those that are not for the support and use of every man who made the Fire to shine for gods and men for every act Let us together all give praise to Him sublime above the Heavens of every nature Lord Tis He who is the Eye of Mind may He accept the praise of these my Powers Ye powers that are within me hymn the One and All sing with my Will Powers all that are within me O blessed Gnosis by thee illumined hymning through thee the Light that mond alone can see I joy in Joy of Mind Sing with me praises all ye Powers Sing praise my Self control sing thou through me my Righteousness the praises of the Righteous sing thou my Sharing all the praises of the All through me sing Truth Truth s praises Sing thou O Good the Good O Life and Light from us to you our praises flow Father I give Thee thanks to Thee Thou Energy of all my Powers I give Thee thanks O God Thou Power of all my Energies Thy Reason Logos sings through me Thy praises Take back through me the All into Thy Reason my reasonable oblation Thus cry the Powers in me They sing Thy praise Thou All they do Thy Will From Thee Thy Will to Thee the All Receive from all their reasonable oblation The All that is in us O Life preserve O Light illumine it O God in spirit it It it Thy Mind that plays the shepherd to Thy Word O Thou Creator Bestower of the Spirit upon all For Thou art God Thy Man thus cries to Thee through Fire through Air through Earth through Water and through Spirit through Thy creatures Tis from Thy Aeon I have found praise giving and in thy Will the object of my search have I found rest Tat By thy good pleasure have I seen this praise giving being sung O father I have set it in my Cosmos too Hermes Say in the Cosmos that thy mind alone can see my son Tat Yea father in the Cosmos that the mind alone can see for I have been made able by thy Hymn and by thy Praise giving my mind hath been illumined But further I myself as well would from my natural mind send praise giving to God Hermes But not unheedfully my son Tat Aye What I behold in mind that do I say To thee thou Parent of my Bringing into Birth as unto God I Tat send reasonable offerings o God and Father thou art the Lord thou art the Mind Receive from me oblations reasonable as thou would st wish for by thy Will all things have been perfected Hermes Send thou oblation son acceptable to God the Sire of all but add my son too through the Word Logos Tat I give thee father thanks for showing me to sing such hymns Hermes Happy am I my son that though hast brought the good fruits forth of Truth products that cannot die And now that thou hast learnt this lesson from me make promise to keep silence on thy virtue and to no soul my son make known the handing on to thee the manner of Rebirth that we may not be thought to be calumniators And now we both of us have given heed sufficiently both I the speaker and the hearer thou In Mind hast thou become a Knower of thyself and our common Sire O my Son write this first Book both for Humanity s sake and for Piety towards God For there can be no Religion more true or just than to know the things that are and to acknowledge thanks for all things to him that made them which thing I shall not cease continually to do What then should a man do O Father to lead his life well seeing there is nothing here true Be Pious and Religious O my Son for he that doth so is the best and highest Philosopher and with out Philosophy it is impossible ever to attain to the height and exactness of Piety or Religion But he that shall learn and study the things that are and how they are ordered and governed and by whom and for what cause or to what end will acknowledge thanks to the Workman as to a good Father an excellent Nurse and a faithful Steward and he that gives thanks shall be Pious or Religious and he that is Religious shall know both where the truth is and what it is and learning that he will be yet more and more Religious For never O Son shall or can that Soul which while it is in the Body lightens and lifts up itself to know and comprehend that which is Good and True slide back to the contrary for it is infinitely enamoured thereof and forgetteth all Evils and when it hath learned and known its Father and progenitor it can no more Apostatize or depart from that Good And let this O Son be the end of Religion and Piety whereunto when thou art once arrived thou shalt both live well and die blessedly whilst thy Soul is not ignorant whether it must return and fly back again For this only O Son is the way to the Truth which our Progenitors travelled in and by which making their Journey they at length attained to the Good It is a Venerable way and plain but hard and difficult for the Soul to go in that is in the Body For first must it war against its own self and after much Strife and Dissention it must be overcome of one part for the Contention is of one against two whilst it flies away and they strive to hold and detain it But the victory of both is not like for the one hasteth to that which is Good but the other is a neighbour to the things that are Evil and that which is Good desireth to be set at Liberty but the things that are Evil love Bondage and Slavery And if the two parts be overcome they become quiet and are content to accept of it as their Ruler but if the one be overcome of the two it is by them led and carried to be punished by its being and continuance here This is O Son the Guide in the way that leads thither for thou must first forsake the Body before thy end and get the victory in this Contention and Strifeful life and when thou hast overcome return But now O my Son I will by Heads run through the things that are understand thou what I say and remember what thou hearest All things that are are moved only that which is not is unmovable Every Body is changeable Not every Body is dissolvable Some Bodies are dissolvable Every living thing is not mortal Not every living thing is immortal That which may be dissolved is also corruptible That which abides always is unchangeable That which is unchangeable is eternal That which is always made is always corrupted That which is made but once is never corrupted neither becomes any other thing First God Secondly the World Thirdly Man The World for Man Man for God Of the Soul that part which is Sensible is mortal but that which is Reasonable is immortal Every essence is immortal Every essence is unchangeable Every thing that is is double None of the things that are stand still Not all things are moved by a Soul but every thing that is is moved by a Soul Every thing that suffers is Sensible every thing that is Sensible suffereth Every thing that is sad rejoiceth also and is a mortal living Creature Not every thing that joyeth is also sad but is an eternal living thing Not every Body is sick every Body that is sick is dissolvable The Mind in God Reasoning or disputing or discoursing in Man Reason in the Mind The Mind is void of suffering No thing in a Body true All that is incorporeal is void of Lying Every thing that is made is corruptible Nothing good upon Earth nothing evil in Heaven God is good Man is evil Good is voluntary or of its own accord Evil is involuntary or against its will The Gods choose good things as good things Time is a Divine thing Law is Humane Malice is the nourishment of the World Time is the Corruption of Man Whatsoever is in Heaven is unalterable All upon Earth is alterable Nothing in Heaven is servanted nothing upon Earth free Nothing unknown in Heaven nothing known upon Earth The things upon Earth communicate not with those in Heaven All things in Heaven are unblameable all things upon Earth are subject to Reprehension That which is immortal is not mortal that which is mortal is not immortal That which is sown is not always begotten but that which is begotten always is sown Of a dissolvable Body there are two Times one from sowing to generation one from generation to death Of an everlasting Body the time is only from the Generation Dissolvable Bodies are increased and diminished Dissolvable matter is altered into contraries to wit Corruption and Generation but Eternal matter into its self and its like The Generation of Man is Corruption the Corruption of Man is the beginning of Generation That which off springs or begetteth another is itself an offspring or begotten by another Of things that are some are in Bodies some in their Ideas Whatsoever things belong to operation or working are in a Body That which is immortal partakes not of that which is mortal That which is mortal cometh not into a Body immortal but that which is immortal cometh into that which is mortal Operations or Workings are not carried upwards but descend downwards Things upon Earth do nothing advantage those in Heaven but all things in Heaven do profit and advantage the things upon Earth Heaven is capable and a fit receptacle of everlasting Bodies the Earth of corruptible Bodies The Earth is brutish the Heaven is reasonable or rational Those things that are in Heaven are subjected or placed under it but the things on Earth are placed upon it Heaven is the first Element Providence is Divine Order Necessity is the Minister or Servant of Providence Fortune is the carriage or effect of that which is without Order the Idol of operation a lying fantasy or opinion What is God The immutable or unalterable Good What is Man An unchangeable Evil If thou perfectly remember these Heads thou canst not forget those things which in more words I have largely expounded unto thee for these are the Contents or Abridgment of them Avoid all Conversation with the multitude or common People for I would not have thee subject to Envy much less to be ridiculous unto the many For the like always takes to itself that which is like but the unlike never agrees with the unlike such Discourses as these have very few Auditors and peradventure very few will have but they have something peculiar unto themselves They do rather sharpen and whet evil men to their maliciousness therefore it behoveth to avoid the multitude and take heed of them as not understanding the virtue and power of the things that are said How dost Thou mean O Father Thus O Son the whole Nature and Composition of those living things called Men is very prone to Maliciousness and is very familiar and as it were nourished with it and therefore is delighted with it Now this wight if it shall come to learn or know that the world was once made and all things are done according to Providence and Necessity Destiny or Fate bearing Rule over all Will he not be much worse than himself despising the whole because it was made And if he may lay the cause of evil upon Fate or Destiny he will never abstain from any evil work Wherefore we must look warily to such kind of people that being in ignorance they may be less evil for fear of that which is hidden and kept secret My Thoughts being once seriously busied about the things that are and my Understanding lifted up all my bodily Senses being exceedingly holden back as it is with them that are very heavy of sleep by reason either of fulness of meat or of bodily labour Me thought I saw one of an exceeding great stature and an infinite greatness call me by my name and say unto me What wouldest thou Hear and See or what wouldest thou Understand to Learn and Know Then said I Who art Thou I am quoth he Poemander the mind of the Great Lord the most Mighty and absolute Emperor I know what thou wouldest have and I am always present with thee Then said I I would Learn the Things that art and Understand the Nature of them and know God How said he I answered That I would gladly hear Then he Have me again in thy mind and whatsoever thou wouldst learn I will teach thee When he had thus said he was changed in his Idea or Form and straightway in the twinkling of an eye all things were opened unto me and I saw an infinite Sight all things were become light both sweet and exceedingly pleasant and I was wonderfully delighted in the beholding it But after a little while there was a darkness made in part coming down obliquely fearful and hideous which seemed unto me to be changed into a Certain Moist Nature unspeakably troubled which yielded a smoke as from fire and from whence proceeded a voice unutterable and very mournful but inarticulate insomuch that it seemed to have come from the Light Then from that Light a certain Holy Word joined itself unto Nature and out flew the pure and unmixed Fire from the moist Nature upward on high it is exceeding Light and Sharp and Operative withal And the Air which was also light followed the Spirit and mounted up to Fire from the Earth and the Water insomuch that it seemed to hang and depend upon it And the Earth and the Water stayed by themselves so mingled together that the Earth could not be seen for the Water but they were moved because of the Spiritual Word that was carried upon them Then said Poemander unto me Dost thou understand this Vision and what it meaneth I shall know said I Then said he I am that Light the Mind thy God who am before that Moist Nature that appeareth out of Darkness and that Bright and Lightful Word from the Mind is the Son of God How is that quoth I Thus replied he Understand it That which in thee Seeth and Heareth the Word of the Lord and the Mind the Father God Differeth not One from the Other and the Unison of these is Life Trismegistus I thank thee Pimander But first conceive well the Light in thy mind and know it When he had thus said for a long time me looked steadfastly one upon the other insomuch that I trembled at his Idea or Form But when he nodded to me I beheld in my mind the Light that is in innumerable and the truly indefinite Ornament or World and that the Fire is comprehended or contained in or by a most great Power and constrained to keep its station These things I understood seeing the word of Pimander and when I was mightily amazed he said again unto me Hast thou seen in thy mind that Archetypal Form which was before the Interminated and Infinite Beginning Thus Pimander to me But whence quoth I or whereof are the Elements of Nature made Pimander Of the Will and Counsel of God which taking the Word and beholding the beautiful World in the Archetype thereof imitated it and so made this World by the principles and vital Seeds or Soul like productions of itself For the Mind being God Male and Female Life and Light brought forth by his Word another Mind the Workman Which being God of the Fire and the Spirit fashioned and formed seven other Governors which in their Circles contain the Sensible World whose Government or Disposition is called Fate or Destiny Straightway leaped out or exalted itself front the downward born Elements of God the Word of God into the clean and pure Workmanship of Nature and was united to the Workman Mind for it was Consubstantial and so the downward born Elements of Nature were left without Reason that they might be the only Matter But the Workman Mind together with the Word containing the Circles and Whirling them about turned round as a Wheel his own Workmanships and suffered them to be turned from an indefinite Beginning to an undeterminable End for they always begin where they end And the Circulation or running round of these as the Mind willeth out of the lower or downward born Elements brought forth unreasonable or brutish creatures for they had no reason the Air flying things and the Water such as swim And the Earth and the Water was separated either from the other as the Mind would and the Earth brought forth from herself such Living Creatures as she had four footed and creeping Beasts wild and tame But the Father of all things the Mind being Life and Light brought forth Man like unto himself whom he loved as his proper Birth for he was all beauteous having the Image of his Father For indeed God was exceedingly enamoured of his own Form or Shape and delivered unto it all his own Workmanships But he seeing and understanding the Creation of the Workman in the whole would needs also himself Fall to Work and so was separated from the Father being in the sphere of Generation or operation Having all Power he considered the Operations or Workmanships of the Seven but they loved him and every one made him partaker of his own Order And he learning diligently and understanding their Essence and partaking their nature resolved to pierce and break through the Circumference of the Circles and to understand the Power of him that sits upon the Fire And having already all power of mortal things of the Living and of the unreasonable Creatures of the World stooped down and peeped through the Harmony and breaking through the strength of the Circles so shewed and made manifest the downward born Nature the fair and beautiful Shape or Form of God Which when he saw having in itself the unsatiable Beauty and all the Operation of the Seven Governors and the Form or Shape of God he Smiled for love as if he had seen the Shape or Likeness in the Water or the shadow upon the Earth of the fairest Human form And seeing in the Water a shape a shape like unto himself in himself he loved it and would cohabit with it and immediately upon the resolution ensued the Operation and brought forth the unreasonable Image or Shape Nature presently laying hold of what it so much loved did wholly wrap herself about it and they were mingled for they loved one another And for this cause Man above all things that live upon Earth is double Mortal because of his Body and Immortal because of the substantial Man For being immortal and having power of all things he yet suffers mortal things and such as are subject to Fate or Destiny And therefore being above all Harmony he is made and become a servant to Harmony And being Hermaphrodite or Male and Female and watchful he is governed by and subjected to a Father that is both Male and Female and watchful After these things I said Thou art my Mind and I am in love with Reason Then said Pimander This is the Mystery that to this day is hidden and kept secret for Nature being mingled with Man brought forth a Wonder most wonderful for he having the Nature of the Harmony of the Seven from him whom I told thee the Fire and the Spirit Nature continued not but forth with brought forth seven Men all Males and Females and sublime or on high according to the Natures of the Seven Governors And after these things O Pimander quoth I I am now come into a great desire and longing to hear do not digress or run out But he said Keep silence for I have not yet finished the first speech Trismegistus Behold I am silent Pimander The Generation therefore of these Seven was after this manner the Air being Feminine and the Water desirous of Copulation took from the Fire its ripeness and from the aether Spirit and so Nature produced bodies after the Species and Shape of men And Man was made of Life and Light into Soul and Mind of Life the Soul of Light the Mind And so all the Members of the Sensible World continued unto the period of the end bearing rule and generating Hear now the rest of that speech thou so much desirest to hear When that Period was fulfilled the bond of all things was loosed and untied by the Will of God for all living Creatures being Hermaphroditical or Male and Female were loosed and untied together with Man and so the Males were apart by themselves and the Females likewise And straightway God said to the Holy Word Increase in Increasing and Multiply in Multitude all you my Creatures and Workmanships And let Him that is endued with Mind know Himself to be Immortal and that the cause of Death is the Love of the Body and let Him Learn all Things that are When he had thus said Providence by Fate and Harmony made the mixtures and established the Generations and all things were multiplied according to their kind and he that knew himself came at length to the Superstantial of every way substantial good But he that through the Error of Love loved the Body abideth wandering in darkness sensible suffering the things of death Trismegistus But why do they that are ignorant sin so much that they should therefore be deprived of immortality Pimander Thou seemest not to have understood what thou hast heard Trismegistus Per ad venture I seem so to thee but I both understand and remember them Pimander I am glad for thy sake if thou understoodest them Trismegistus Tell me why are they worthy of death that are in death Pimander Because there goeth a sad and dismal darkness before its Body of which darkness is the moist Nature of which moist Nature the Body consisteth in the sensible World from whence death is derived Hast thou understood this aright Trismegistus But why or how doth he that understands himself go or pass into God Pimander That which the Word of God said say I Because the Father of all things consists of Life and Light whereof Man is made Trismegistus Thou sayest very well Pimander God and the Father is Light and Life of which Man is made If therefore thou learn and believe thyself to be of the Life and Light thou shalt again pass into Life Trismegistus But yet tell me more O my Mind how I shall go into Life Pimander God saith Let the Man endued with a Mind mark consider and know himself well Trismegistus Have not all Men a mind Pimander Take heed what thou sayest for I the Mind come unto men that are holy and good pure and merciful and that live piously and religiously and my presence is a help unto them And forthwith they know all things and lovingly they supplicate and propitiate the Father and blessing him they give him thanks and sing hymns unto him being ordered and directed by filial Affection and natural Love And before they give up their Bodies to the death of them they hate their Senses knowing their Works and Operations Rather I that am the Mind itself will not suffer the Operations or Works which happen or belong to the body to be finished and brought to perfection in them but being the Porter and Door keeper I will shut up the entrances of Evil and cut off the thoughtful desires of filthy works But to the foolish and evil and wicked and envious and covetous and murderous and profane I am far off giving place to the avenging Demon which applying unto him the sharpness of fire tormenteth such a man sensibly and armeth him the more to all wickedness that he may obtain the greater punishment And such a one never ceaseth having unfulfillable desires and unsatiable concupiscences and always fighting in darkness for the Demon afflicts and tormenteth him continually and increaseth the fire upon him more and more Trismegistus Thou hast O Mind most excellently taught me all things as I desired but tell me moreover after the return is made what then Pimander First of all in the resolution of the material Body the Body itself is given up to alteration and the form which it had becometh invisible and the idle manners are permitted and left to the Demon and the Senses of the Body return into their Fountains being parts and again made up into Operations And Anger and Concupiscence go into the brutish or unreasonable Nature and the rest striveth upward by Harmony And to the first Zone it giveth the power it had of increasing and diminishing To the second the machination or plotting of evils and one effectual deceit or craft To the third the idle deceit of Concupiscence To the fourth the desire of Rule and unsatiable Ambition To the fifth profane Boldness and headlong rashness of Confidence To the sixth Evil and ineffectual occasions of Riches And to the seventh Zone subtle Falsehood always lying in wait And then being made naked of all the Operations of Harmony it cometh to the eighth Nature having its proper power and singeth praises to the Father with the things that are and all they that are present rejoice and congratulate the coming of it and being made like to them with whom it converseth it heareth also the Powers that are above the eighth Nature singing praise to God in a certain voice that is peculiar to them And then in order they return unto the Father and themselves deliver themselves to the powers and becoming powers they are in God This is the Good and to them that know to be deified Furthermore why sayest thou What resteth but that understanding all men thou become a guide and way leader to them that are worthy that the kind of Humanity or Mankind may be saved by God When Pimander had thus said unto me he was mingled among the Powers But I giving thanks and blessing the Father of all things rose up being enabled by him and taught the Nature of the Nature of the whole and having seen the greatest sight or spectacle And I began to Preach unto men the beauty and fairness of Piety and Knowledge O ye People Men born and made of the Earth which have given Yourselves over to Drunkenness and Sleep and to the Ignorance of God be Sober and Cease your Surfeit whereto you are allured and invited by Brutish and Unreasonable Sleep And they that heard me come willingly and with one accord and then I said further Why O Men of the Off spring of the Earth why have you delivered Yourselves over unto Death having Power to Partake of Immortality Repent and Change your Minds you that have together Walked in Error and have been Darkened in Ignorance Depart from that dark Light be Partakers of Immortality and Leave or Forsake Corruption And some of Them That Heard Me mocking and scorning went away and delivered themselves up to the way of death But others casting themselves down before my feet besought me that they might be taught but I causing them to rise up became a guide of mankind teaching them the reasons how and by what means they may be saved And I sowed in them the words of Wisdom and nourished them with Ambrosian Water of Immortality And when it was Evening and the Brightness of the same began wholly to go down I commanded them to give thanks to God and when they had finished their thanksgiving everyone returned to his own lodging But I wrote in myself the bounty and beneficence of Pimander and being filled with what I most desired I was exceeding glad For the sleep of the Body was the sober watchfulness of the mind and the shutting of my eyes the true Sight and my silence great with child and full of good and the pronouncing of my words the blossoms and fruits of good things And thus came to pass or happened unto me which I received from my mind that is Pimander the Lord of the Word whereby I became inspired by God with the Truth For which cause with my Soul and whole strength I give praise and blessing unto God the Father Holy is God the Father of All Things Holy is God Whose Will is Performed and Accomplished by His Own Powers Holy is God that Determineth to be Known and is Known of His Own or Those that are His Holy art Thou that by Thy Word hast established all Things Holy art Thou of Whom all Nature is the Image Holy art Thou Whom Nature hath not Formed Holy art Thou that art Stronger than all Power Holy art Thou that art Greater than all Excellency Holy art Thou Who art Better than all Praise Accept these Reasonable Sacrifices from a Pure Soul and a Heart stretched out unto Thee O Thou Unspeakable Unutterable to be Praised with Silence beseech Thee that I may never Err from the Knowledge of Thee Look Mercifully upon Me and Enable Me and Enlighten with this Grace those that are in Ignorance the Brothers of my Kind but Thy Sons Therefore I Believe Thee and Bear Witness and go into the Life and Light Blessed art Thou O Father Thy Man would be Sanctified with Thee as Thou hast given Him all Power The glory of all things God and that which is Divine and the Divine Nature the beginning of things that are God and the Mind and Nature and Matter and Operation or Working and Necessity and the End and Renovation For there were in the Chaos an infinite darkness in the Abyss or bottomless Depth and Water and a subtle Spirit intelligible in Power and there went out the Holy Light and the Elements were coagulated from the Sand out of the moist Substance And all the Gods distinguished the Nature full of Seeds And when all things were interminated and unmade up the light things were divided on high And the heavy things were founded upon the moist sand all things being Terminated or Divided by Fire and being sustained or hung up by the Spirit they were so carried and the Heaven was seen in Seven Circles And the Gods were seen in their Ideas of the Stars with all their Signs and the Stars were numbered with the Gods in them And the Sphere was all lined with Air carried about in a circular motion by the Spirit of God And every God by his internal power did that which was commanded him and there were made four footed things and creeping things and such as live in the Water and such as fly and every fruitful Seed and Grass and the Flowers of all Greens and which had sowed in themselves the Seeds of Regeneration As also the Generations of men to the knowledge of the Divine Works and a lively or working Testimony of Nature and a multitude of men and the Dominion of all things under Heaven and the knowledge of good things and to be increased in increasing and multiplied in multitude And every Soul in flesh by the wonderful working of the Gods in the Circles to the beholding of Heaven the Gods Divine Works and the Operations of Nature and for Signs of good things and the knowledge of the Divine Power and to find out every cunning workmanship of good things So it beginneth to live in them and to be wise according to the Operation of the course of the circular Gods and to be resolved into that which shall be great Monuments and Remembrances of the cunning Works done upon Earth leaving them to be read by the darkness of times And every generation of living flesh of Fruit Seed and all Handicrafts though they be lost must of necessity be renewed by the renovation of the Gods and of the Nature of a Circle moving in number for it is a Divine thing that every world temperature should be renewed by nature for in that which is Divine is Nature also established Yesterday s Speech O Asclepius I dedicated to thee this day s it is fit to dedicate to Tat because it is an Epitome of those general speeches that were spoken to him God therefore and the Father and the Good O Tat have the same Nature or rather also the same Act and Operation For there is one name or appellation of Nature and Increase which concerneth things changeable and another about things unchangeable and about things unmoveable that is to say Things Divine and Human every one of which himself will have so to be but action or operation is of another thing or elsewhere as we have taught in other things Divine and Human which must here also be understood For his Operation or Act is his Will and his Essence to Will all Things to be For what is God and the Father and the Good but the Being of all things that yet are not and the existence itself of those things that are This is God this is the Father this is the Good whereunto no other thing is present or approacheth For the World and the Sun which is also a Father by Participation is not for all that equally the cause of Good and of Life to living Creatures And if this be so he is altogether constrained by the Will of the Good without which it is not possible either to be or to be begotten or made But the Father is the cause of his Children who hath a will both to sow and nourish that which is good by the Son For Good is always active or busy in making and this cannot he in any other but in him that taketh nothing and yet willeth all things to be for I will not say O Tat making them for he that maketh is defective in much time in which sometimes he maketh not as also of quantity and quality for sometimes he maketh those things that have quantity and quality and sometimes the contrary But God is the Father and the Good in being all things for he both will be this and is it and yet all this for himself as is true in him that can see it For all things else are for this it is the property of Good to be known This is the Good O Tat Tat Thou hast filled us O Father with a sight both good and fair and the eye of my mind is almost become more holy by the sight or spectacle Trismegistus I Wonder not at It for the Sight of Good is not like the Beam of the Sun which being of a fiery shining brightness maketh the eye blind by his excessive Light that gazeth upon it rather the contrary for it enlighteneth and so much increaseth the light of the eye as any man is able to receive the influence of this Intelligible clearness For it is more swift and sharp to pierce and innocent or harmless withal and full of immortality and they that are capable and can draw any store of this spectacle and sight do many times fall asleep from the Body into this most fair and beauteous Vision which thing Celius and Saturn our Progenitors obtained unto Tat I would we also O Father could do so Trismegistus I would have could O Son but for the present we are less intent to the Vision and cannot yet open the eyes of our minds to behold the incorruptible and incomprehensible Beauty of that Good But then shall we see it when we have nothing at all to say of it For the knowledge of it is a Divine Silence and the rest of all the Senses For neither can he that understands that understand anything else nor he that sees that see any thing else nor hear any other thing nor in sum move the Body For shining steadfastly upon and round about the whole Mind it enlighteneth all the Soul and loosing it from the Bodily Senses and Motions it draweth it from the Body and changeth it wholly into the Essence of God For it is Possible for the Soul O Son to be Deified while yet it Lodgeth in the Body of Man if it Contemplate the Beauty of the Good Tat How dost thou mean deifying Father Trismegistus There are differences O Son of every Soul Tat But how dost thou again divide the changes Trismegistus Hast thou not heard in the general Speeches that from one Soul of the Universe are all those Souls which in all the world are tossed up and down as it were and severally divided Of these Souls there are many changes some into a more fortunate estate and some quite contrary for they which are of creeping things are changed into those of watery things and those of things living in the water to those of things living upon the Land and Airy ones are changed into men and human Souls that lay hold of immortality are changed into Demons And so they go on into the Sphere or Region of the fixed Gods for there are two choirs or companies of Gods one of them that wander and another of them that are fixed And this is the most perfect glory of the Soul But the Soul entering into the Body of a Man if it continue evil shall neither taste of immortality nor is partaker of the good But being drawn back the same way it returneth into creeping things And this is the condemnation of an evil Soul And the wickedness of a Soul is ignorance for the Soul that knows nothing of the things that are neither the Nature of them nor that which is good but is blinded rusheth and dasheth against the bodily Passions and unhappy as it is not knowing itself it serveth strange Bodies and evil ones carrying the Body as a burthen and not ruling but ruled And this is the mischief of the Soul On the contrary the virtue of the Soul is Knowledge for he that knows is both good and religious and already Divine Tat But who is such a one O Father Trismegistus He that neither speaks nor hears many things for he O Son that heareth two speeches or hearings fighteth in the shadow For God and the Father and Good is neither spoken nor heard This being so in all things that are are the Senses because they cannot be without them But Knowledge differs much from Sense for Sense is of things that surmount it but Knowledge is the end of Sense Knowledge is the gift of God for all Knowledge is unbodily but useth the Mind as an Instrument as the Mind useth the Body Therefore both intelligible and material things go both of them into bodies for of contraposition That is Setting One against Another and Contrariety all Things must Consist And it is impossible it should be otherwise Tat who therefore is this material God Trismegistus The fair and beautiful world and yet it is not good for it is material and easily passible nay it is the first of all passible things and the second of the things that are and needy or wanting somewhat else And it was once made and is always and is ever in generation and made and continually makes or generates things that have quantity and quality For it is moveable and every material motion is generation but the intellectual stability moves the material motion after this manner Because the World Is a Sphere that is a Head and above the head there is nothing material as beneath the feet there is nothing intellectual The whole universe is material The Mind is the head and it is moved spherically that is like a head Whatsoever therefore is joined or united to the Membrane or Film of this head wherein the Soul is is immortal and as in the Soul of a made Body hath its Soul full of the Body but those that are further from that Membrane have the Body full of Soul The whole is a living wight and therefore consisteth of material and intellectual And the World is the first and Man the second living wight after the World but the first of things that are mortal and therefore hath whatsoever benefit of the Soul all the others have And yet for all this he is not only not good but flatly evil as being mortal For the World is not good as it is moveable nor evil as it is immortal But man is evil both as he is moveable and as he is mortal But the Soul of Man is carried in this manner The Mind is in Reason Reason in the Soul the Soul in the Spirit the Spirit in the Body The Spirit being diffused and going through the veins and arteries and blood both moveth the living Creature and after a certain manner beareth it Wherefore some also have thought the Soul to be blood being deceived in Nature not knowing that first the Spirit must return into the Soul and then the blood is congealed the veins and arteries emptied and then the living thing dieth And this is the death of the Body All things depend of one beginning and the beginning depends of that which is one and alone And the beginning is moved that it may again be a beginning but that which is one standeth and abideth and is not moved There are therefore these three God the Father and the Good the World and Man God hath the World and the World hath Man and the World is the Son of God and Man as it were the Offspring of the World For God is not ignorant of R Ian but knows him perfectly and will be known by him This only is healthful to man the Knowledge of God this is the return of Olympus by this only the Soul is made good and not sometimes good and sometimes evil but of necessity Good Tat What meanest thou O Father Trismegistus Consider O Son the Soul of a Child when as yet it hath received no dissolution of its Body which is not yet grown but is very small how then if it look upon itself it sees itself beautiful as not having been yet spotted with the Passions of the Body but as it were depending yet upon the Soul of the World But when the Body is grown and distracteth the Soul it engenders Forgetfulness and partakes no more of the Fair and the Good and Forgetfulness is Evilness The like also happeneth to them that go out of the Body for when the Soul runs back into itself the Spirit is contracted into the blood and the Soul into the Spirit but the Mind being made pure and free from these clothings and being Divine by Nature taking a fiery Body rangeth abroad in every place leaving the Soul to judgment and to the punishment it hath deserved Tat Why dost thou say so O Father that the Mind is separated from the Soul and the Soul from the Spirit When even now thou saidst the Soul was the Clothing or Apparel of the Mind and the Body of the Soul Trismegistus O Son he that hears must co understand and conspire in thought with him that speaks yea he must have his hearing swifter and sharper than the voice of the speaker The disposition of these Clothings or Covers is done in an Earthly Body for it is impossible that the mind should establish or rest itself naked and of itself in an Earthly Body neither is the Earthly Body able to bear such immortality and therefore that it might suffer so great virtue the Mind compacted as it were and took to itself the passible Body of the Soul as a Covering or Clothing And the Soul being also in some sort Divine useth the Spirit as her Minister and Servant and the Spirit governeth the living thing When therefore the Mind is separated and departeth from the earthly Body presently it puts on its Fiery Coat which it could not do having to dwell in an Earthly Body For the Earth cannot suffer fire for it is all burned of a small spark therefore is the water poured round about the Earth as a Wall or defence to withstand the flame of fire But the Mind being the most sharp or swift of all the Divine Cogitations and more swift than all the Elements hath the fire for its Body For the Mind which is the Workman of all useth the fire as his instrument in his Workmanship and he that is the Workman of all useth it to the making of all things as it is used by man to the making of Earthly things only for the Mind that is upon Earth void or naked of fire cannot do the business of men nor that which is otherwise the affairs of God But the Soul of Man and yet not everyone but that which is pious and religious is Angelical and Divine And such a Soul after it is departed from the Body having striven the strife of Piety becomes either Mind or God And the strife of Piety is to know God and to injure no Man and this way it becomes Mind But an impious Soul abideth in its own essence punished of itself and seeking an earthly and human Body to enter into For no other Body is capable of a Human Soul neither is it lawful for a Man s Soul to fall into the Body of an unreasonable living thing for it is the Law or Decree of God to preserve a Human Soul from so great a contumely and reproach Tat How then is the Soul of Man punished O Father and what is its greatest torment Hermes Impiety O my Son for what Fire hath so great a flame as it Or what biting Beast doth so tear the Body as it doth the Soul Or dost thou not see how many evils the wicked Soul suffereth roaring and crying out I am Burned I am Consumed I know not what to Say or Do I am Devoured Unhappy Wretch of the Evils that compass and lay hold upon me Miserable that I am I neither See nor Hear anything These are the voices of a punished and tormented Soul and not as many and thou O Son thinkest that the Soul going out of the Body grows brutish or enters into a Beast which is a very great Error for the Soul punished after this manner For the Mind when it is ordered or appointed to get a fiery Body for the services of God coming down into the wicked Soul torments it with the whips of Sins wherewith the wicked Soul being scourged turns itself to Murders and Contumelies and Blasphemies and divers Violences and other things by which men are injured But into a pious Soul the Mind entering leads it into the Light of Knowledge And such a Soul is never satisfied with singing praise to God and speaking well of all men and both in words and deeds always doing good in imitation of her Father Therefore O Son we must give thanks and pray that we may obtain a good mind The Soul therefore may be altered or changed into the better but into the worse it is impossible But there is a communion of Souls and those of Gods communicate with those of men and those of men with those of Beasts And the better always take of the worse Gods of Men Men of brute Beasts but God of all For he is the best of all and all things are less than he Therefore is the World subject unto God Man unto the World and unreasonable things to Man But God is above all and about all and the beams of God are operations and the beams of the World are Natures and the beams of Man are Arts and Sciences And Operations do act by the World and upon man by the natural beams of the World but Natures work by the Elements and man by Arts and Sciences And this is the Government of the whole depending upon the Nature of the One and piercing or coming down by the One Mind than which nothing is more Divine and more efficacious or operative and nothing more uniting or nothing is more One The Communion of Gods to Men and of Men to God This is the Bonus Genius or good Demon blessed Soul that is fullest of it and unhappy Soul that is empty of it Tat And wherefore Father Trismegistus Know Son that every Soul hath the Good Mind for of that it is we now speak and not of that Minister of which we said before That he was sent from the Judgment For the Soul without the Mind can neither do nor say any thing for many times the Mind flies away from the Soul and in that hour the Soul neither seeth nor heareth but is like an unreasonable thing so great is the power of the Mind But neither brooketh it an idle or lazy Soul but leaves such a one fastened to the Body and by it pressed down And such a Soul O Son hath no mind wherefore neither must such a one be called a Man For man is a Divine living thing and is not to be compared to any brute Beast that lives upon Earth but to them that are above in Heaven that are called Gods Rather if we shall be bold to speak the truth he that is a man indeed is above them or at least they are equal in power one to the other For none of the things in Heaven will come down upon Earth and leave the limits of Heaven but a man ascends up into Heaven and measures it And he knoweth what things are on high and what below and learneth all other things exactly And that which is the greatest of all he leaveth not the Earth and yet is above So great is the greatness of his Nature Wherefore we must be bold to say That an Earthly Man is a Mortal God and That the Heavenly God is an Immortal Man Wherefore by these two are all things governed the World and Man but they and all things else of that which is One That God is not Manifest and yet most Manifest This Discourse I will also make to thee O Tat that thou mayest not be ignorant of the more excellent Name of God But do thou contemplate in thy Mind how that which to many seems hidden and unmanifest may be most manifest unto thee For it were not all if it were apparent for whatsoever is apparent is generated or made for it was made manifest but that which is not manifest is ever For it needeth not to be manifested for it is always And he maketh all other things manifest being unmanifest as being always and making other things manifest he is not made manifest Himself is not made yet in fantasy he fantasieth all things or in appearance he maketh them appear for appearance is only of those things that are generated or made for appearance is nothing but generation But he is that One that is not made nor generated is also unapparent and unmanifest But making all things appear he appeareth in all and by all but especially he is manifested to or in those things wherein himself listeth Thou therefore O Tat my Son pray first to the Lord and Father and to the Alone and to the One from whom is one to be merciful to thee that thou mayest knowest and understand so great a God and that he would shine one of his beams upon thee In thy understanding For only the Understanding sees that which is not manifest or apparent as being itself not manifest or apparent and if thou canst O Tat it will appear to the eyes of thy Mind For the Lord void of envy appeareth through the whole world Thou mayest see the intelligence and take it in thy hands and contemplate the Image of God But if that which is in thee be not known or apparent unto thee how shall he in thee be seen and appear unto thee by the eyes But if thou wilt see him consider and understand the Sun consider the course of the Moon consider the order of the Stars Who is he that keepeth order for all order is circumscribed or terminated in number and place The Sun is the greatest of the Gods in heaven to whom all the heavenly Gods give place as to a King and potentate and yet he being such a one greater than the Earth or the Sea is content to suffer infinite lesser stars to walk and move above himself whom doth he fear the while O Son Every one of these Stars that are in Heaven do not make the like or an equal course who is it that hath prescribed unto every one the manner and the greatness of their course This Bear that turns round about its own self and carries round the whole World with her who possessed and made such an Instrument Who hath set the Bounds to the Sea who hath established the Earth for there is some body O Tat that is the Maker and Lord of these things For it is impossible O Son that either place or number or measure should be observed without a Maker For no order can be made by disorder or disproportion would it were possible for thee O my Son to have wings and to fly into the Air and being taken up in the midst between Heaven and Earth to see the stability of the Earth the fluidness of the Sea the courses of the Rivers the largeness of the Air the sharpness or swiftness of the Fire the motion of the Stars and the speediness of the Heaven by which it goeth round about all these O Son what a happy sight it were at one instant to see all these that which is unmovable moved and that which is hidden appear and be manifest And if thou wilt see and behold this Workman even by mortal things that are upon Earth and in the deep Consider O Son how Man is made and framed in the Womb and examine diligently the skill and cunning of the Workman and learn who it was that wrought and fashioned the beautiful and Divine shape of Man who circumscribed and marked out his eyes who bored his nostrils and ears who opened his mouth who stretched out and tied together his sinews who channelled the veins who hardened and made strong the bones who clothed the flesh with skin who divided the fingers and the joints who flatted and made broad the soles of the feet who digged the pores who stretched out the spleen who made the heart like a Pyramis who made the Liver broad who made the Lights spungy and full of holes who made the belly large and capacious who set to outward view the more honourable parts and hid the filthy ones See how many Arts in one Matter and how many Works in one Superscription and all exceedingly beautiful and all done in measure and yet all differing Who hath made all these things what Mother what Father save only God that is not manifest that made all things by his own Will And no man says that a statue or an image is made without a Carver or a Painter and was this Workmanship made without a Workman O great Blindness O great Impiety O great Ignorance Never O Son Tat canst thou deprive the Workmanship of the Workman rather it is the best Name of all the Names of God to call him the Father of all for so he is alone and this is his Work to be the Father And if thou wilt force me to say anything more boldly it is his Essence to be pregnant or great with all things and to make them And as without a Maker it is impossible that anything should be made so it is that he should not always be and always be making all things in Heaven in the Air in the Earth in the Deep in the whole World and in every part of the whole that is or that is not For there is nothing in the whole World that is not himself both the things that are and the things that are not For the things that are he hath made manifest and the things that are not he hath hid in himself This is God that is better than any name this is he that is secret this is he that is most manifest this is he that is to be seen by the Mind this is he that is visible to the eye this is he that hath no body and this is he that hath many bodies rather there is nothing of any body which is not He For he alone is all things And for this cause He hath all Names because He is the One Father and therefore He hath no Name because He is the Father of all Who therefore can bless thee or give thanks for thee or to thee Which way shall I look when I praise thee upward downward outward inward For about thee there is no manner nor place nor anything else of all things that are But all things are in thee all things from thee thou givest all things and takest nothing for thou hast all things and there is nothing that thou hast not When shall I praise thee O Father for it is neither possible to comprehend thy hour nor thy time For what shall I praise thee for what thou hast made or for what thou hast not made fur those things thou hast manifested or for those things thou hast hidden Wherefore shall I praise thee as being of myself or having anything of mine own or rather being another s For thou art what I am thou art what I do thou art what I say Thou Art All Things and there is Nothing Else Thou art not Thou Art Thou All that is Made and all that is not Made The Mind that Understandeth The Father that Maketh and Frameth The Good that Worketh The Good that doth All Things Of the Matter the most subtle and slender part is Air of the Air the Soul of the Soul the Mind of the Mind God Good O Asciepius is in nothing but in God alone or rather God himself is the Good always And if it be so then must he be an Essence or Substance void of all motion and generation but nothing is void or empty of him And this Essence hath about or in himself a Stable and firm Operation wanting nothing most full and giving abundantly One thing is the Beginning of all things for it giveth all things and when I name the Good I mean that which is altogether and always Good This is present to none but God alone for he wanteth nothing that he should desire to have it nor can anything be taken from him the loss whereof may grieve him for sorrow is a part of evilness Nothing is stronger than he that he should be opposed by it nor nothing equal to him that he should be in love with it nothing unheard of to be angry with nothing wiser to be envious at And none of these being in his Essence what remains but only the Good For as in this being such an Essence there is none of the evils so in none of the other things shall the Good be found For in all other things are all those other things as well in the small as the great and as well in the particulars as in this living Creature the greater and mightiest of all For all things that are made or generated are full of Passion Generation itself being a Passion and where Passion is there is not the Good where the Good is there is no Passion where it is day it is not night and where it is night it is not day Wherefore it is impossible that in Generation should be the Good but only in that which is not generated or made Yet as the Participation of all things is in the Matter bound so also of that which is Good After this manner is the World good as it maketh all things and in the part of making or doing it is Good but in all other things not good For it is passible and movable and the Maker of passible things In Man also the Good is ordered or Taketh Denomination in comparison of that which is evil for that which is not very evil is here good and that which is here called Good is the least particle or proportion of evil It is impossible therefore that the Good should be here pure from Evil for here the Good groweth Evil and growing Evil it doth not still abide Good and not abiding Good it becomes Evil Therefore in God alone is the Good or rather God is the Good Therefore O Asclepius there is nothing in men or among Men but the name of Good the thing itself is not for it is impossible for a material Body receiveth or Comprehendeth is not as being on every side encompassed and coarcted with evilness and labours and griefs and desires and wrath and deceits and foolish opinions And in that which is the worst of all Asclepius every one of the forenamed things is here believed to be the greatest good especially that supreme mischief the pleasures of the Belly and the ring leader of all evils Error is here the absence of the Good And I give thanks unto God that concerning the knowledge of Good put this assurance in my mind that it is impossible it should be in the World For the World is the fulness of evilness but God is the fulness of Good or Good of God For the eminencies of all appearing Beauty are in the Essence more pure more sincere and peradventure they are also the Essence of it For we must be bold to say Asclepius that the Essence of God if he have an Essence is that which is fair or beautiful but no good is comprehended in this World For all things that are subject to the eye are Idols and as it were shadows but those things that are not subject to the eye are ever especially the Essence of the Fair and the Good And as the eye cannot see God so neither the Fair and the Good For these are the parts of God that partake the Nature of the whole proper and familiar unto him alone inseparable most lovely whereof either God is enamoured or they are enamoured of God If thou canst understand God thou shalt understand the Fair and the Good which is most shining and enlightening and most enlightened by God For that Beauty is above comparison and that Good is inimitable as God himself As therefore thou understandest God so understand the Fair and the Good for these are incommunicable to any other living Creatures because they are inseparable from God If thou seek concerning God thou seekest or askest also of the Fair for there is one way that leads to the same thing that is Piety with Knowledge Wherefore they that are ignorant and go not in the way of Piety dare call Man Fair and Good never seeing so much as in a dream what Good is but being enfolded and wrapped upon all evil and believing that the evil is the Good they by that means both use it unsatiably and are afraid to be deprived of it and therefore they strive by all possible means that they may not only have it but also increase it Such O Asclepius are the Good and Fair things of men which we can neither love nor hate for this is the hardest thing of all that we have need of them and cannot live without them Tat In the general Speeches O Father discoursing of the Divinity thou speakest enigmatically and didst not clearly reveal thyself saying That no man can be saved before Regeneration And when I did humbly entreat thee at the going up the Mountain after thou hadst discoursed unto me having a great desire to learn this Argument of Regeneration because among all the rest I am ignorant only of this thou toldst me thou wouldst impart it unto me when I would estrange myself from the World whereupon I made myself ready and have vindicated the understanding that is in me from the deceit of the World Now then fulfill my defects and as thou saidst instruct me of Regeneration either by word of mouth or secretly for I know not O Trismegistus of what Substance or what Womb or what Seed a Man is thus born Hermes O Son this Wisdom is to be understood in silence and the Seed is the true Good Tat Who soweth it O Father for I am utterly ignorant and doubtful Hermes The Will of God O Son And what manner of Man is he that is thus born for in this point I am clean deprived of the Essence that understandeth in me Hermes The Son of God will be another God made the universe that in everything consisteth of all powers Tat Thou tellest me a Riddle Father and dost not speak as a Father to his Son Hermes Son things of this kind are not taught but are by God when he pleaseth brought to remembrance Tat Thou speakest of things strained or far fetched and impossible Father and therefore I will directly contradict them Hermes Wilt thou prove a stranger Son to thy Father s kind Do not envy me Father or pardon me I am thy Natural Son discourse unto me the manner of Regeneration Hermes What shall I say O my Son I have nothing to say more than this that I see in myself an unfeigned sight or spectacle made by the mercy of God and I am gone out of myself into an immortal body and am riot now what I was before but was begotten in Mind This thing is not taught nor is it to be seen in this formed Element for which the first compound form was neglected by me and that I am now separated from it for I have both the touch and the measure of it yet am I now estranged from them Thou seest O Son with thine eyes but though thou look never so steadfastly upon me with the Body and bodily sight thou canst not see nor understand what I am now Tat Thou hast driven me O Father into no small fury and distraction of mind for I do not now see my self Hermes I would O Son that thou also wert gone out of thyself like them that dream in their sleep Tat Then tell me this who is the Author and Maker of Regeneration Hermes The child of God one Man by the Will of God Tat Now O Father thou hast put me to silence for ever and all my former thoughts have quite left and forsaken me for I see the greatness and shape of all things here below and nothing but falsehood in them all And since this mortal Form is daily changed and turned by this time into increase and diminution as being falsehood what therefore is true O Trismegistus Trismegistus That O Son which is not troubled nor bounded not coloured not figured not changed that which is naked bright comprehensible only of itself unalterable unbodily Tat Now I am mad indeed Father for when I thought me to have been made a wise man by thee with these thoughts thou hast quite dulled all my senses Hermes Yet is it so as I say O Son He that Looketh Only upon that which is carried upward as Fire that which is carried downward as Earth that which is moist as Water and that which bloweth or is subject to blast as Air how can he sensibly understand that which is neither hard nor moist nor tangible nor perspicuous seeing it is only understood in power and operation but I beseech and pray to the Mind which alone can understand the Generation which is in God Tat Then am I O Father utterly unable to do it Hermes God forbid Son rather draw or pull him unto thee or Study to Know Him and he will come be but Willing and it shall be done quiet or make idle the Senses of the Body purging thyself from unreasonable brutish torments of matter Tat Have I any revengers or tormentors in myself Father Hermes Yes and those not a few but many and fearful ones Tat I do not know them Father Hermes One Torment Son is Ignorance a second Sorrow a third Intemperance a fourth Concupiscence a fifth Injustice a sixth Covetousness a seventh Deceit an eighth Envy a ninth Fraud or Guile a tenth Wrath an eleventh Rashness a twelfth Maliciousness They are in number twelve and under these many more some which through the prison of the body do force the inwardly placed Man to suffer sensibly And they do not suddenly or easily depart from him that hath obtained mercy of God and herein consists both the manner and the reason of Regeneration For the rest O Son hold thy peace and praise God in silence and by that means the mercy of God will not cease or be wanting unto us Therefore rejoice my Son from henceforward being purged by the powers of God to the Knowledge of the Truth For the revelation of God is come to us and when that came all Ignorance was cast out The knowledge of Joy is come unto us and when that comes Sorrow shall fly away to them that are capable of it call unto Joy the power of Temperance a power whose Virtue is most sweet Let us take her unto ourselves O Son most willingly for how at her coming hath she put away Intemperance Now I call the fourth Continence the power which is over Concupiscence This O Son is the stable and firm foundation of Justice For see how without labour she hath chased away injustice and we are justified O Son when Injustice is away The sixth Virtue which comes into us I call Communion which is against Covetousness And when that Covetousness is gone I call Truth and when she cometh Error and Deceit vanisheth See O Son how the Good is fulfilled by the access of Truth for by this means Envy is gone from us for Truth is accompanied with the Good together also with Life and Light And there came no more any torment of Darkness but being overcome they are all fled away suddenly and tumultuarily Thou hast understood O Son the manner of Regeneration for upon the coming of these Ten the Intellectual Generation is perfected and then it driveth away the twelve and we have seen it in the Generation itself Whosoever therefore hath of Mercy obtained this Generation which is according to God he leaving all bodily sense knoweth himself to consist of divine things and rejoiceth being made by God stable and immutable Tat O Father I conceive and understand not by the sight of mine eyes but by the Intellectual Operation which is by the Powers I am in Heaven in the Earth in the Water in the Air I am in living Creatures in the Plants in the Womb everywhere Yet tell me further this one thing How are the torments of Darkness being in number Twelve driven away and expelled by the Ten powers What is the manner of it Trismegistus Hermes This Tabernacle O Son consists of the Zodiacal Circle and this consisting of twelve numbers the Idea of one but all formed Nature admit of divers Conjugations to the deceiving of Man And though they be different in themselves yet are they united in practice as for example Rashness is inseparable from Anger and they are also indeterminate Therefore with good Reason do they make their departure being driven away by the Ten powers that is to say By the dead For the number of Ten O Son is the Begetter of Souls And there Life and Light are united where the number of Unity is born of the Spirit Therefore according to Reason Unity bath the number of Ten and the number of Ten hath Unity Tat O Father I now see the Universe and myself in the Mind Hermes This is Regeneration O Son that we should not any longer fix our imagination upon this Body subject to the three dimensions according to this Speech which we have now commented That we may not at all calumniate the Universe Tat Tell me O Father This Body that consists of Powers shall it ever admit of any Dissolution Hermes Good words Son and speak not things impossible for so thou shalt sin and the eye of thy mind grow wicked The sensible Body of Nature is far from the Essential Generation for that is subject to Dissolution but this not and that is mortal but this immortal Dost thou not know that thou art born a God and the Son of the One as I am Tat How fain would I O Father hear that praise given by a Hymn which thou saidst thou heardst from the Powers when I was in the Octonary Hermes As Pimander said by way of Oracle to the Octonary Thou dost well O Son to desire the Solution of the Tabernacle for thou art purified Pimander the Mind of absolute Power and Authority hath delivered no more unto me than those that are written knowing that of myself I can understand all things and hear and see what I will And he commanded me to do those things that are good and therefore all the Powers that are in me sing Tat I would hear thee O Father and understand these things Hermes Be quiet O Son and now hearken to that harmonious blessing and thanksgiving the hymn of Regeneration which I did not determine to have spoken of so plainly but to thyself in the end of all Wherefore this is not taught but hid in silence So then O Son do thou standing in the open Air worship looking to the North Wind about the going down of the Sun and to the South when the Sun ariseth And now keep silence Son The Secret Song The Holy Speech Let all the Nature of the world entertain the hearing of this Hymn Be opened O Earth and let all the Treasure of the Rain be opened You Trees tremble not for I will sing and praise the Lord of the Creation and the All and the One Be opened you Heavens ye Winds stand still and let the Immortal Circle of God receive these words For I will sing and praise him that created all things that fixed the Earth and hung up the Heavens and commanded the sweet Water to come out of the Ocean into all the World inhabited and not inhabited to the use and nourishment of all things or men That commanded the fire to shine for very action both to Gods and Men Let us altogether give him blessing which rideth upon the Heavens the Creator of all Nature This is he that is the Eye of the Mind and Will accept the praise of my Powers O all ye Powers that are in me praise the One and the All Sing together with my Will all you Powers that are in me O Holy Knowledge being enlightened by thee I magnify the intelligible Light and rejoice in the Joy of the Mind All my Powers sing praise with me and thou my Continence sing praise my Righteousness by me praise that which is righteous O Communion which is in me praise the All By me the Truth sings praise to the Truth the Good praiseth the Good O Life O Light from us unto you comes this praise and thanksgiving give thanks unto thee O Father the operation or act of my Powers I give thanks unto thee O God the power of my operations By me thy Word sings praise unto thee receive by me this reasonable or verbal sacrifice in words The powers that are in me cry these things they praise the All they fulfil thy Will thy Will and Counsel is from thee unto thee O All receive a reasonable Sacrifice from all things O Life save all that is in us O Light enlighten O God the Spirit for the Mind guideth or feedeth the Word O Spirit bearing Workman Thou art God thy Man crieth these things unto thee through by the Fire by the Air by the Earth by the Water by the Spirit by thy Creatures From eternity I have found means to bless and praise thee and I have what I seek for I rest in thy Will Tat O Father I see thou hast sung this Song of praise and blessing with thy whole Will and therefore have I put and placed it in my World Hermes Say in thy intelligible World O Son Tat I do mean in my Intelligible World for by thy Hymn and Song of Praise my mind is enlightened and gladly would I send from my Understanding a Thanksgiving unto God Hermes Not rashly O Son Tat In my mind O Father Hermes Those things that I see and contemplate I infuse into thee and therefore say thou son Tat the Author of thy succeeding Generations I send unto God these reasonable Sacrifices O God Thou art the Father Thou art the Lord Thou art the Mind accept these reasonable Sacrifices which Thou requirest of Me For all things are done as the Mind willeth Thou O Son send this acceptable Sacrifice to God the Father of all things but propound it also O Son by Word Tat I thank thee Father thou hast advised and instructed me thus to give praise and thanks Hermes I am glad O Son to see the Truth bring forth the Fruits of Good things and such immortal branches And learn this of me Above all other virtues entertain Silence and impart unto no man O Son the tradition of Regeneration lest we be reputed Calumniators For we both have now sufficiently meditated I in speaking thou in hearing And now thou dost intellectually know thyself and our Father Whither are you carried O Men drunken with drinking up the strong Wine of Ignorance which seeing you cannot bear Why do you not vomit it up again Stand and be sober and look up again with the eyes of your heart and if you cannot all do so yet do as many as you can For the malice of Ignorance surroundeth all the Earth and corrupteth the Soul shut up in the Body not suffering it to arrive at the Havens of Salvation Suffer not yourselves to he carried with the great stream but stem the tide you that can lay hold of the Haven of Safety and make your full course towards it Seek one that may lead you by the hand and conduct you to the door of Truth and Knowledge where the clear Light is that is pure from Darkness where there is not one drunken but all are sober and in their heart look up to him whose pleasure it is to be seen For he cannot be heard with ears nor seen with eyes nor expressed in words but only in mind and heart But first thou must tear to pieces and break through the garment thou wearest the web of Ignorance the foundation of all Mischief the bond of Corruption the dark Coverture the living Death the sensible Carcass the Sepulchre carried about with us the domestical Thief which in what he loves us hates us envies us Such is the hurtful Apparel wherewith thou art clothed which draws and pulls thee downward by its own self lest looking up and seeing the beauty of Truth and the Good that is reposed therein thou shouldst hate the wickedness of this garment and understand the traps and ambushes which it hath laid for thee Therefore doth it labour to make good those things that seem and are by the Senses judged and determined and the things that are truly it hides and envelopeth in such matter filling what it presents unto thee with hateful pleasure that thou canst neither hear what thou shouldst hear nor see what thou shouldst see Hermes All that is moved O Asclepius is it not moved in some thing and by some thing Asclepius Yes indeed Hermes Must not that in which a thing is moved of necessity be greater than the thing that is moved Of necessity And that which moveth is it not stronger than that which is moved Asclepius It is stronger Hermes That in which a thing is moved must it not needs have a Nature contrary to that of the thing that is moved Asclepius It must needs Hermes Is not this great World a Body than which there is no greater Asclepius Yes confessedly Hermes And is it not solid as filled with many great bodies and indeed with all the Bodies that are Asclepius It is so Hermes And is not the World a Body and a Body that is moved Asclepius It is Hermes Then what kind of a place must it be wherein it is moved and of what Nature Must it not be much bigger that it may receive the continuity of Motion and lest that which is moved should for want of room he stayed and hindered in the Motion Asclepius It must needs be an immense thing Trismegistus but of what Nature Hermes Of a contrary Nature O Asclepius but is not the Nature of things unbodily contrary to a Body Asclepius Confessedly Hermes Therefore the place is unbodily but that which is unbodily is either some Divine thing or God himself And by some thing Divine I do not mean that which was made or begotten If therefore it be Divine it is an Essence or Substance but if it be God it is above Essence but he is otherwise intelligible For the first God is intelligible not to himself but to us for that which is intelligible is subject to that which understandeth by Sense Therefore God is not intelligible to himself for not being any other thing from that which is understood he cannot be understood by himself But he is another thing from us and therefore he is understood by us If therefore Place be intelligible it is not Place but God but if God be intelligible he is intelligible not as Mace but as a capable Operation Now everything that is moved is moved not in or by that which is moved but in that which standeth or resteth and that which moveth standeth or resteth for it is impossible it should be moved with it Asclepius How then O Trismegistus are those things that are here moved with the things that are moved for thou sayest that the Spheres that wander are moved by the Sphere that wanders not Hermes That O Asclepius is not a moving together but a countermotion for they are not moved after a like manner but contrary one to the other and contrariety hath a standing resistance of motion for resistance is a staying of motion Therefore the wandering Spheres being moved contrarily to that Sphere which wandereth not shall have one from another contrariety standing of itself For this Bear which thou seest neither rise nor go down but turning always about the same dost thou think it moveth or standeth still Asclepius I think it moves Trismegistus What motion O Asclepius Asclepius A motion that is always carried about the same But the Circulation which is about the same and the motion about the same are both hidden by Station for that which is about the same forbids that which is above the same if it stand to that which is about the same And so the contrary motion stands fast always being always established by the contrariety But I will give thee concerning this matter an earthly example that may be seen with eyes Look upon any of these living Creatures upon Earth as Man for example and see him swimming for as the Water is carried one way the reluctation or resistance of his feet and hands is made a station to the man that he should not be carried with the Water nor sink underneath it Asclepius Thou hast laid down a very clear example Trismegistus Hermes Therefore every motion is in station and is moved of station The motion then of the World and of every material living thing happeneth not to be done by those things that are without the World but by those things within it a Soul or Spirit or some other unbodily thing to those things which are without it For an inanimated Body doth not now much less a Body if it be wholly inanimate Asclepius What meaneth thou by this O Trismegistus Wood and Stones and all other inanimate things are they not moving Bodies Hermes By no means O Asclepius for that within the Body which moves the inanimate thing is not the Body that moves both as well the Body of that which beareth as the Body of that which is born for one dead or inanimate thing cannot move another that which moveth must needs be alive if it move Thou seest therefore how the Soul is surcharged when it carrieth two Bodies And now it is manifest that the things that are moved are moved in something and by something Asclepius The things that are O Trismegistus must needs be moved in that which is void or empty Vacuum Be advised O Asclepius for of all the things that are there is nothing empty only that which is not is empty and a stranger to existence or being But that which is could not be if it were not full of existence for that which is in being or existence can never be made empty Asclepius Are there not therefore some things that are empty O Trismegistus as an empty Barrel an empty Hogshead an empty Well an empty Wine Press and many such like Hermes O the grossness of thy Error O Asclepius those things that are most full and replenished dost thou account them void and empty Asclepius What may be thy meaning Trismegistus Hermes Is not the Air a Body Asclepius It is a Body Hermes Why then this Body doth it not pass through all things that are and passing through them fill them and that Body doth it not consist of the mixture of the four therefore all those thou callest empty are full of Air Therefore those things that thou callest empty thou oughtest to call them hollow not empty for they exist and are full of Air and Spirit Asclepius This reason is beyond all contradiction O Trismegistus but what shall we call the Place in which the whole Universe is moved Hermes Call it incorporeal O Asclepius Asclepius What is that incorporeal or unbodily Hermes The Mind and Reason the whole wholly comprehending itself free from all Body undeceivable invisible impassible from a Body itself standing fast in itself capable of all things and that favour of the things that are Whereof the Good the Truth the Archetypal Light the Archetype of the Soul are as it were Beams Asclepius Why then what is God Hermes That which is none of these things yet is and is the cause of Being to all and every one of the things that are for he left nothing destitute of Being And all things are made of things that are and not of things that are not for the things that are not have not the nature to be able to be made and again the things that are have not the nature never to be or not to be at all Asclepius What dost thou then say at length that God is Hermes God is not a Mind but the Cause that the Mind is not a Spirit but the Cause that the Spirit is not Light but the Cause that Light is Therefore we must worship God by these two Appellations which are proper to him alone and to no other For neither of all the other which are called Gods nor of Men nor Demons or Angels can anyone be though never so little good save only God alone And this He is and nothing else but all other things are separable from the nature of Good For the Body and the Soul have no place that is capable of or can contain the Good For the greatness of Good is as great as the Existence of all things that are both bodily and unbodily both sensible and intelligible This is the Good even God See therefore that thou do not at any time call ought else Good for so thou shalt be impious or any else God but only the Good for so thou shalt again be impious In Word it is often said by all men the Good but all men do not understand what it is but through Ignorance they call both the Gods and some men Good that can never either be or be made so Therefore all the other Gods are honoured with the title and appellation of God but God is the Good not according to Heaven but Nature For there is one Nature of God even the Good and one kind of them both from whence are all kinds For he that is Good is the giver of all things and takes nothing and therefore God gives all things and receives nothing The other title and appellation is the Father because of his making all things for it is the part of a Father to make Therefore it bath been the greatest and most Religious care in this life to them that are wise and well minded to beget children As likewise it is the greatest misfortune and impiety for any to be separated from men without children and this man is punished after death by the Demons and the punishment is this To have the Soul of this childless man adjudged and condemned to a Body that neither bath the nature of a man nor of a woman which is an accursed thing under the Sun Therefore O Asclepius never congratulate any man that is childless but on the contrary pity his misfortune knowing what punishment abides and is prepared for him Let so many and such manner of things O Asclepius be said as a certain precognition of all things in Nature Forbear thy speech O Hermes Trismegistus and call to mind those things that are said but I will not delay to speak what comes into my mind since many men have spoken many things and those very different concerning the Universe and Good but I have not learned the Truth Therefore the Lord make it plain to me in this point for I will believe thee only for the manifestation of these things Then said the Mind how the case stands God and all God Eternity the World Time Generation God made Eternity Eternity the World the World Time and Time Generation Of God as it were the Substance is the Good the Fair Blessedness Wisdom Of Eternity Identity or Selfness Of the World Order Of Time Change Of Generation Life and Death But the Operation of God is Mind and Soul Of Eternity Permanence or Long lasting and Immortality Of the World Restitution and Decay or Destruction Of Time Augmentation and Diminution And of Generation Qualities Therefore Eternity is in God The World in Eternity Time in the World And Generation in Time And Eternity standeth about God The World is moved in Eternity Time is determined in the World Generation is done in Time Therefore the Spring and Fountain of all things is God The Substance Eternity The Matter is the World The Power of God is Eternity And the Work of Eternity is the World not yet made and yet ever made by Eternity Therefore shall nothing be at any time destroyed for Eternity is incorruptible Neither can anything perish or be destroyed in the World the World being contained and embraced by eternity But what is the Wisdom of God Even the Good and the Fair and Blessedness and every Virtue and Eternity Eternity therefore put into the Matter Immortality and Everlastingness for the Generation of that depends upon Eternity even as Eternity doth of God For Generation and Time in Heaven and in Earth are of a double Nature in Heaven they are unchangeable and incorruptible but on Earth they are changeable and corruptible And the Soul of Eternity is God and the Soul of the World Eternity and of the Earth Heaven God is in the Mind the Mind in the Soull the Soul in the Matter all things by Eternity All this Universal Body in which are all Bodies is full of Soul the Soul full of Mind the Mind full of God For within he fills them and without he contains them quickening the Universe Without he quickens this perfect living thing the World and within all living Creatures And above in Heaven he abides in Identity or Selfness but below upon Earth he changeth Generation Eternity comprehendeth the World either by Necessity or Providence or Nature And if any man shall think any other thing it is God that actuateth or operateth this All But the operation or Act of God is power insuperable to which none may compare anything either Human or Divine Therefore O Hermes think none of these things below or the things above in any wise like unto God for if thou dost thou errest from the Truth For nothing can be like the unlike and only and One nor mayest thou think that he bath given of his Power to any other thing For who after him can make anything either of Life or Immortality of Change or of Quality and himself what other thing should he make For God is not idle for then all things would be idle for all things are full of God But there is not anywhere in the world such a thing as Idleness for Idleness is a name that implieth a thing void or empty both of a Doer and a thing done But all things must necessarily be made or done both always and according to the nature of every place For he that maketh or doth is in all things yet not fastened or comprehended in anything nor making or doing one thing but all things For being an active or operating Power and sufficient of himself for the things that are made and the things that are made are under him Look upon through me the World is subject to thy sight and understand exactly the Beauty thereof A Body immarcessible than the which there is nothing more ancient yet always vigorous and young See also the seven Worlds set over us adorned with an everlasting Order and filling Eternity with a different course For all things are full of Light but the Fire is nowhere For the friendship and commixture of contraries and unlike became Light shining from the Act or Operation of God the Father of all Good the Prince of all Order and the Ruler of the seven Worlds Look also upon the Moon the forerunner of them all the Instrument of Nature and which changeth the Matter here below Behold the Earth the middle of the whole the firm and stable Foundation of the Fair World the Feeder and Nurse of Earthly things Consider moreover how great the multitude is of immortal living things and of mortal ones also and see the Moon going about in the midst of both to wit of things immortal and mortal But all things are full of Soul and all things are properly moved by it some things about the Heaven and some things about the Earth and neither of those on the right hand to the left nor those on the left hand to the right nor those things that are above down ward nor those things that are below upwards And that all these things are made O beloved Hermes thou needst not learn of me For they are Bodies and have a Soul and are moved And that all these should come together into one it is impossible without some thing to gather them together Therefore there must be some such ones and he altogether One For seeing that the motions are divers and many and the Bodies not alike and yet one ordered swiftness among them all It is impossible there should be two or more Makers For one order is not kept by many But in the weaker there would be jealousy of the stronger and thence also Contentions And if there were one Maker of mutable and mortal living wights he would desire also to make immortal ones as he that were the Maker of immortal ones would do to make mortal Moreover also if there were two the Matter being one who should be chief or have the disposing of the facture Or if both of them which of them the greater part But think thus that every living Body bath its consistence of Matter and Soul and of that which is immortal and that which is mortal and unreasonable For all living Bodies have a Soul and those things that are not living are only matter by itself And the Soul likewise of itself drawing near her Maker is the Cause of Life and Being and Being the cause of Life is after a manner the cause of immortal things How then are mortal wights other from immortal Or how cannot he make living wights that causeth immortal things and immortality That there is some Body that doth these things it is apparent and that he is also one it is most manifest For there is one Soul one Life and one Matter Who is this Who can it be Other than the One God For whom else can it benefit to make living things save only God alone There is therefore one God For it is a ridiculous thing to confess the World to be one Sun one Moon one Divinity and yet to have I know not how many gods He therefore being One doth all things in many things And what great thing is it for God to make Life and Soul and Immortality and Change when thy self dost so many things For thou both seest speakest and hearest smellest tastest and touchest walkest understandest and breathest And it is not one that seeth and another that heareth and another that speaketh and another that toucheth and another that smelleth and another that walketh and another that understandeth and another that breatheth but One that doth all these things Yet neither can these things possibly be without God For as thou if thou shouldst cease from doing these things were not a living wight so if God should cease from those he were not which is not lawful to say any longer God For if it be already demonstrated that nothing can be idle or empty how much more may be affirmed of God For if there be any thing which he doth not do then is he if it were lawful to say so imperfect Whereas feeling he is not idle but perfect certainly he doth all things Now give thy self unto me O Hermes for a little while thou shalt the more easily understand that it is the necessary work of God that all things should be made or done that are done or were once done or shall be done And this O best Beloved is life And this is the Fair And this is the Good And this is God And if thou wilt understand this by work also mark what happens to thy self when thou wilt generate And yet this is not like unto him for he is not sensible of pleasure for neither bath he any other Fellow workman But being himself the only Workman he is always in the Work himself being that which he doth or maketh For all things if they were separated from him must needs fall and die as there being no life in them And again if all things be living wights both which are in Heaven and upon Earth and that there be one Life in all things which are made by God and that is God then certainly all things are made or done by God Life is the union of the Mind and the Soul But death is not the destruction of those things that were gathered together but a dissolving of the Union The Image therefore of God is Eternity of Eternity the World of the World the Sun of the Sun Man But the people say That changing is Death because the Body is dissolved and the Life goeth into that which appeareth not By this discourse my dearest Hermes I affirm as thou hearest That the World is changed because every day part thereof becomes invisible but that it is never dissolved And these are the Passions of the World Revolutions and Occultations and Revolution is a turning but Occultation is Renovation And the World being all formed bath not the forms lying without it but itself changeth in itself Seeing then the World is all formed what must he be that made it for without form he cannot be And if he be all formed he will be kept like the World but if he have but one form he shall be in this regard less than the World What do we then say that he is we will not raise any doubts by our speech for nothing that is doubtful concerning God is yet known He hath therefore one Idea which is proper to him which because it is unbodily is not subject to the sight and yet shews all forms by the Bodies And do not wonder if there be an incorruptible Idea For they are like the Margents of that Speech which is in writing for they seem to be high and swelling hut they are by nature smooth and even But understand well this that I say more boldly for it is more true As a man cannot live without life so neither can God live not doing good For this is as it were the Life and Motion of God to move all things and quicken them But some of the things I have said must have a particular explication Understand then what I say All things are in God not as lying in a place for Place is both a Body and unmoveable and those things that are there placed have no motion For they lie otherwise in that which is unbodily than in the fantasy or to appearance Consider him that contains all things and understand that nothing is more capacious than that which is incorporeal nothing more swift nothing more powerful but it is most capacious most swift and most strong And judge of this by thyself command thy Soul to go into India and sooner than thou canst bid it it will be there Bid it likewise pass over the Ocean and suddenly it will be there Not as passing from place to place but suddenly it will be there Command it to fly into Heaven and it will need no Wings neither shall anything hinder it not the fire of the Sun not the Aether not the turning of the Spheres not the bodies of any of the other Stars but cutting through all it will fly up to the last and furthest Body And if thou wilt even break the whole and see those things that are without the World if there be any thing without thou mayest Behold how great power how great swiftness thou hast Canst thou do all these things and cannot God After this manner therefore contemplate God to have all the whole World to himself as it were all thoughts or intellections If therefore thou wilt not equal thy self to God thou canst not understand God For the like is intelligible by the like Increase thy self into an immeasurable greatness leaping beyond every Body and transcending all Time become Eternity and thou shalt understand God If thou believe in thyself that nothing is impossible but accountest thy self immortal and that thou canst understand all things every Art every Science and the manner and custom of every living thing Become higher than all height lower than all depths comprehend in thy self the qualities of all the Creatures of the Fire the Water the Dry and Moist and conceive likewise that thou canst at once be everywhere in the Sea in the Earth Thou shalt at once understand thy self not yet begotten in the Womb young old to be dead the things after death and all these together as also times places deeds qualities quantities or else thou canst not yet understand God But if thou shut up thy Soul in the Body and abuse it and say I understand nothing I can do nothing I am afraid of the Sea I cannot climb up into Heaven I know not who I am I cannot tell what I shall be what hast thou to do with God for thou canst understand none of those Fair and Good things be a lover of the Body and Evil For it is the greatest evil not to know God But to be able to know and to will and to hope is the straight way and Divine way proper to the Good and it will everywhere meet thee and everywhere be seen of thee plain and easy when thou dost not expect or look for it it will meet thee waking sleeping sailing travelling by night by day when thou speakest and when thou keepest silence For there is nothing which is not the Image of God And yet thou sayest God is invisible but be advised for who is more manifest than He For therefore hath he made all things that thou by all things mayest see him This is the Good of God this is his Virtue to appear and to be seen in all things There is nothing invisible no not of those things that are incorporeal The Mind is seen in Understanding and God is seen in doing or making Let these things thus far forth be made manifest unto thee O Trismegistus Understand in like manner all other things by thy self and thou shalt not be deceived The Mind O Tat is of the very Essence of God if yet there be any Essence of God What kind of Essence that is he alone knows himself exactly The Mind therefore is not cut off or divided from the essentiality of God but united as the light of the sun And this mind in men is God and therefore are some men Divine and their Humanity is near Divinity For the good Demon called the Gods immortal men and men mortal Gods But in the brute Beasts or unreasonable living wights the Mind is their Nature For where there is a Soul there is the Mind as where there is Life there is also a Soul In living Creatures therefore that are without Reason the Soul is Life void of the operations of the Mind For the Mind is the Benefactor of the Souls of men and worketh to the proper Good And in unreasonable things it co operateth with the Nature of everyone of them but in men it worketh against their Natures For the Soul being in the Body is straightway made Evil by Sorrow and Grief and Pleasure or Delight For Grief and Pleasure flow like Juices from the compound Body whereinto when the Soul entereth or descendeth she is moistened and tincted with them As many Souls therefore as the Mind governeth or overruleth to them it shows its own Light resisting their prepossessions or presumptions As a good Physician grieveth the Body prepossessed of a disease by burning or lancing it for health s sake After the same manner also the Mind grieveth the Soul by drawing it out of Pleasure from whence every disease of the Soul proceedeth But the great Disease of the Soul is Atheism because that opinion followeth to all Evil and no Good Therefore the Mind resisting it procureth Good to the Soul as a Physician health to the Body But as many Souls of Men as do not admit or entertain the Mind for their Governor do suffer the same thing that the Soul of unreasonable living things For the Soul being a Co operator with them permits or leaves them to their concupiscences whereunto they are carried by the torrent of their Appetite and so tend to brutishness And as Brute Beasts they are angry without reason and they desire without reason and never cease nor are satisfied with evil For unreasonable Angers and Desires are the most exceeding Evils And therefore hath God set the Mind over these as a Revenger and Reprover of them Tat Here O Father that discourse of Fate or Destiny which thou madest to me is in danger to be overthrown For if it be fatal for any man to commit Adultery or Sacrilege or do any evil he is punished also though he of necessity do the work of Fate or Destiny Hermes All things O Son are the work of Fate and without it can no bodily thing either Good or Evil be done For it is decreed by Fate that he that cloth any evil should also suffer for it And therefore he cloth it that he may suffer that which he suffereth because he did it But for the present let alone that speech concerning Evil and Fate for at other times we have spoken of it Now our discourse is about the Mind and what it can do and how it differs and is in men such a one but in brute Beasts changed And again in Brute Beasts it is not beneficial but in men by quenching both their Anger and Concupiscences And of men thou must understand some to be rational or governed by reason and some irrational But all men are subject to Fate and to Generation and Changes for these are the beginning and end of Fate or Destiny And all men suffer those things that are decreed by Fate But rational men over whom as we said the Mind bears rule do not suffer like unto other men but being free from viciousness and being not evil they do suffer evil Tat How sayest thou this again Father An Adulterer is he not evil a Murderer is he not evil and so all others Hermes But the rational man O Son will not suffer for Adultery but as the Adulterer nor for Murder but as the Murderer And it is impossible to escape the Quality of Change as of Generation but the Viciousness he that hath the Mind may escape And therefore O Son I have always heard the good Demon say and if he had delivered it in writing he had much profited all mankind For he alone O Son as the first born God seeing all things truly spake Divine words I have heard him say sometimes That all Things are one thing Especially Intelligible Bodies or that all Especially Intelligible Bodies are one We live in Power in Act and in Eternity Therefore a good Mind is that which the Soul of him is And if this be so then no intelligible thing differs from intelligible things As therefore it is possible that the Mind the Prince of all things so likewise that the Soul that is of God can do whatsoever it will But understand thou well for this Discourse I have made to the question which thou askest of me before I mean concerning Fate and the Mind First if O Son thou shalt diligently withdraw thy self from all Contentious speeches thou shalt find that in Truth the Mind the Soul of God bears rule over all things both over Fate and Law and all other things And nothing is impossible to him no not of the things that are of Fate Therefore though the Soul of man be above it let it not neglect the things that happen to be under Fate And these thus far were the excellent sayings of the good Demon Tat Most divinely spoken O Father and truly and profitably yet clear this one thing unto me Thou sayest that in brute Beasts the Mind worketh or acteth after the manner of Nature co operating also with their impetus inclinations Now the impetuous inclinations of brute Beasts as I conceive are Passions If therefore the Mind do co operate with these impetuous Inclinations and that they are the Passions in brute Beasts certainly the Mind is also a Passion conforming itself to Passions Hermes Well done Son thou askest nobly and yet it is just that I should answer thee All incorporeal things O Son that are in the Body are possible nay they are properly Passions Everything that moveth is incorporeal everything that is moved is a Body and it is moved into the Bodies by the Mind Now motion is Passion and there they both suffer as well that which moveth as that which is moved as well that which ruleth as that which is ruled But being freed from the Body it is freed likewise from Passion But especially O Son there is nothing impassible but all things are passible But Passion differs from that which is passible for that Passion acteth but this suffers Bodies also of themselves do act for either they are unmovable or else are moved and which soever it be it is a Passion But incorporeal things do always act or work and therefore they are passible Let not therefore the appellations or names trouble thee for Action and Passion are the same thing but that it is not grievous to use the more honourable name Tat O Father thou has delivered this Discourse most plainly Hermes Consider this also O Son That God hath freely bestowed upon man above all other living things these two to wit Mind and Speech or Reason equal to immortality These if any man use or employ upon what he ought he shall differ nothing from the Immortals Yea rather going out of the Body he shall be guided and led by them both into the Choir and Society of the Gods and blessed Ones Tat Do not other living Creatures use Speech O Father Hermes NO Son but only Voice now Speech and Voice do differ exceeding much for Speech is common to all men but Voice is proper unto every kind of living thing Tat Yea but the Speech of men is different O Father every man according to his Nation Hermes It is true O Son they do differ Yet as man is one so is Speech one also and it is interpreted and found the same both in Egypt Persia and Greece But thou seemest unto me Son to be ignorant of the Virtue or Power and Greatness of Speech For the blessed God the good Demon said or commanded the Soul to be in the Body the Mind in the Soul the Word or Speech or Reason in the Mind and the Mind in God and that God is the Father of them all Therefore the Word is the Image of the Mind and the Mind of God and the Body of the Idea and the Idea of the Soul Therefore of the Matter the subtlest or smallest part is Air of the Air the Soul of the Soul the Mind of the Mind God And God is about all things and through all things but the Mind about the Soul the Soul about the Air and the Air about the Matter But Necessity and Providence and Nature are the Organs or Instruments of the World and of the Order of Matter For of those things that are intelligible every one is but the Essence of them in Identity But of the Bodies of the whole or universe every one is many things For the Bodies that are put together and that have and make their changes into other having this Identity do always save and preserve the uncorruption of the Identity But in every one of the compound Bodies there is a number For without number it is impossible there should be consistence or constitution or composition or dissolution But Unities do both beget and increase Numbers and again being dissolved come into themselves And the Matter is One But this whole World the great God and the Image of the Greater and united unto him and conserving the Order and Will of the Father is the fulness of Life And there is nothing therein through all the Eternity of the Revolutions neither of the whole nor of the parts which cloth not live For there is nothing dead that either hath been or is or shall be in the World For the Father would have it as long as it lasts to be a living thing and therefore it must needs be God also How therefore O Son can there be in God in the Image of the Universe in the fulness of Life any dead things For dying is corruption and corruption is destruction How then can any part of the incorruptible be corrupted or of God be destroyed Tat Therefore O Father do not the living things in the World die though they be parts thereof Hermes Be wary in thy Speech O Son and not deceived in the names of things For they do not die O Son but as compound Bodies they are dissolved But dissolution is not death and they are dissolved not that they may be destroyed but that they may be made new Tat What then is the operation of Life Is it not Motion Hermes And what is there in the World unmovable Nothing at all O Son Tat Why cloth not the Earth seem unmovable to thee O Father Hermes No but subject to many motions though after a manner it alone be stable What a ridiculous thing it were that the Nurse of all things should be unmovable which beareth and bringeth forth all things For it is impossible that anything that bringeth forth should bring forth without Motion And a ridiculous question it is Whether the fourth part of the whole be idle For the word immovable or without Motion signifies nothing else but idleness Know generally O Son That whatsoever is in the World is moved either according to Augmentation or Diminution But that which is moved liveth also yet it is not necessary that a living thing should be or continue the same For while the whole World is together it is unchangeable O Son but all the parts thereof are changeable Yet nothing is corrupted or destroyed and quite abolished but the names trouble men For Generation is not Life but Sense neither is Change Death but Forgetfulness or rather Occultation and lying hid Or better thus For Generation is not a Creation of Life but a Production of Things to Sense and making them Manifest Neither is Change Death but an Occultation or Hiding of that which was These things being so all things are Immortal Matter Life Spirit Soul Mind whereof every living thing consisteth Every living thing therefore is Immortal because of the Mind but especially Man who both receiveth God and converseth with him For with this living wight alone is God familiar in the night by dreams in the day by Symbols or Signs And by all things cloth he foretell him of things to come by Birds by Fowls by the Spirit or Wind and by an Oak Wherefore also Man professeth to know things that have been things that are present and things to come Consider this also O Son That every living Creature goeth upon one part of the World Swimming things in Water Land wights upon the Earth Flying Fowls in the Air But Man useth all these the Earth the Water the Air and the Fire nay he seeth and toucheth Heaven by his Sense But God is both about all things and through all things for he is both Act and Power And it is no hard thing O Son to understand God And if thou wilt also see him look upon the Necessity of things that appear and the Providence of things that have been and are done See the Matter being most full of Life and so great a God moved with all Good and Fair both Gods and Demons and Men Tat But these O Father are wholly Acts or Operations Hermes If they be therefore wholly Acts or Operations O Son by whom are they acted or operated but by God Or art thou ignorant that as the parts of the World are Heaven and Earth and Water and Air after the same manner the Members of God are Life and Immortality and Eternity and Spirit and Necessity and Providence and Nature and Soul and Mind and the Continuance or Perseverance of all these which is called Good And there is not any thing of all that hath been and all that is where God is not Tat What in the Matter O Father Hermes The Matter Son what is it without God that thou shouldst ascribe a proper place to it Or what cost thou think it to be peradventure some heap that is not actuated or operated But if it be actuated by whom is it actuated for we have said that Acts or Operations are the parts of God By whom are all living things quickened and the Immortal by whom are they immortalized the things that are changeable by whom are they changed Whether thou speak of Matter or Body or Essence know that all these are acts of God And that the Act of Matter is materiality and of the Bodies corporality and of Essence essentiality and this is God the whole And in the whole there is nothing that is not God Wherefore about God there is neither Greatness Place Quality Figure or Time for he is All and the All through all and about all This Word O Son worship and adore And the only service of God is not to be evil The Workman made this Universal World not with his Hands but his Word Therefore thus think of him as present everywhere and being always and making all things and one above that by his Will hath framed the things that are For that is his Body not tangible nor visible nor measurable nor extensible nor like any other body For it is neither Fire nor Water nor Air nor Wind but all these things are of him for being Good he hath dedicated that name unto himself alone But he would also adorn the Earth but with the Ornament of a Divine Body And he sent Man an Immortal and a Mortal wight And Man had more than all living Creatures and the World because of his Speech and Mind For Man became the spectator of the Works of God and wondered and acknowledged the Maker For he divided Speech among all men but not Mind and yet he envied not any for Envy comes not thither but is of abode here below in the Souls of men that have not the Mind Tat But wherefore Father did not God distribute the Mind to all men Because it pleased him O Son to set that in the middle among all souls as a reward to strive for Tat And where hath he set it Hermes Filling a large Cup or Bowl therewith he sent it down giving also a Cryer or Proclaimer And he commanded him to proclaim these things to the souls of men Dip and wash thyself thou that art able in this Cup or Bowl Thou that believes that thou shalt return to him that sent this Cup thou that acknowledgest whereunto thou wert made As many therefore as understood the Proclamation and were baptised or dowsed into the Mind these were made partakers of Knowledge and became perfect men receiving the Mind But as many as missed of the Proclamation they received Speech but not Mind being ignorant whereunto they were made or by whom But their senses are just like to brute Beasts and having their temper in Anger and Wrath they do not admire the things worthy of looking on But wholly addicted to the pleasures and desires of the Bodies they believe that man was made for them But as many as partook of the gift of God these O Tat in comparison of their works are rather immortal than mortal men Comprehending all things in their Mind which are upon the Earth which are in Heaven and if there be anything above Heaven And lifting up themselves so high they see the Good and seeing it they account it a miserable calamity to make their abode here And despising all things bodily and unbodily they make haste to the One and Only Thus O Tat is the Knowledge of the Mind the beholding of Divine Things and the Understanding of God the Cup itself being Divine Tat And I O Father would be baptised and drenched therein Hermes Except thou first hate thy body O Son thou canst not love thy self but loving thy self thou shalt have the Mind and having the Mind thou shalt also partake the Knowledge or Science Tat HOW meanest thou that O Father Hermes Because it is impossible O Son to be conversant about things Mortal and Divine For the things that are being two Bodies and things incorporeal wherein is the Mortal and the Divine the Election or Choice of either is left to him that will choose For no man can choose both And of which soever the choice is made the other being diminished or overcome magnifieth the act and operation of the other The choice of the hefter therefore is not only best for him that chooseth it by deifying a man but it also sheweth Piety and Religion towards God But the choice of the worse destroys a man but cloth nothing against God save that as Pomps or Pageants when they come abroad cannot do any thing themselves but hinder after the same manner also do these make Pomps or Pageants in the World being seduced by the pleasures of the Body These things being so O Tat that things have been and are so plenteously ministered to us from God let them proceed also from us without any scarcity or sparing For God is innocent or guiltless but we are the causes of Evil preferring them before the Good Thou seest O Son how many Bodies we must go beyond and how many choirs of Demons and what continuity and courses of Stars that we may make haste to the One and only God For the Good is not to be transcended it is unbounded and infinite unto itself without beginning but unto us seeming to have a beginning even our knowledge of it For our knowledge is not the beginning of it but shews us the beginning of its being known unto us Let us therefore lay hold of the beginning and we shall quickly go through all things It is indeed a difficult thing to leave those things that are accustomable and present and turn us to those things that are ancient and according to the original For these things that appear delight us but make the things that appear not hard to believe or the Things that Appear not are Hard to believe The things most apparent are Evil but the Good is secret or hid in or to the things that appear for it hath neither Form nor Figure For this cause it is like to itself but unlike every thing else for it is impossible that any thing incorporeal should be made known or appear to a Body For this is the difference between the like and the unlike and the unlike wanteth always somewhat of the like For the Unity Beginning and Root of all things as being the Root and Beginning Nothing is without a beginning but the Beginning is of nothing but of itself for it is the Beginning of all other things Therefore it is seeing it is not from another beginning Unity therefore being the Beginning containeth every number but itself is contained of none and begetteth every number itself being begotten of no other number Every thing that is begotten or made is imperfect and may be divided increased diminished But to the perfect there happeneth none of these And that which is increased is increased by Unity but is consumed and vanished through weakness being not able to receive the Unity This Image of God have I described to thee O Tat as well as I could which if thou do diligently consider and view by the eyes of thy mind and heart believe me Son thou shalt find the way to the things above or rather the Image itself will lead thee But the spectacle or sight hath this peculiar and proper Them that can see and behold it it holds fast and draws unto it as they say the Loadstone cloth Iron Yesterday Asclepius I delivered a perfect Discourse but now I think it necessary in suite of that to dispute also of Sense For Sense and Understanding seem to differ because the one is material the other essential But unto me they appear to be both one or united and not divided in men I mean For in other living Creatures Sense is united unto Nature but in men to Understanding But the Mind differs from Understanding as much as God from Divinity For Divinity is from or under God and Understanding from the Mind being the sister of the Word or Speech and they the Instruments one of another For neither is the Word pronounced without Understanding neither is Understanding manifested without the Word Therefore Sense and Understanding do both flow together into a man as if they were infolded one within another For neither is it possible without Sense to Understand nor can we have Sense without Understanding And yet it is possible for the Time being that the Understanding may understand without Sense as they that fantasy Visions in their Dreams But it seems unto me that both the operations are in the Visions of Dreams and that the Sense is stirred up out of sleep unto awaking For man is divided into a Body and a Soul when both parts of the Sense accord one with another then is the understanding childed or brought forth by the Mind pronounced For the Mind brings forth all Intellections or Understandings Good ones w hen it receiveth good Seed from God and the contrary when it receives them from Devils For there is no part of the World void of the Devil which entering in privately sowed the seed of his own proper operation and the Mind did make pregnant or did bring forth that which was sown Adulteries Murders Striking of Parents Sacrileges Impieties Stranglings throwing down headlong and all other things which are the works of evil Demons And the Seeds of God are few but Great and Fair and Good Virtue and Temperance and Piety And the Piety is the Knowledge of God whom whosoever knoweth being full of all good things hath Divine Understanding and not like the Many And therefore they that have that Knowledge neither please the multitude nor the multitude them but they seem to be mad and to move laughter hated and despised and many times also murdered For we have already said That wickedness must dwell here being in her own region For her region is the Earth and not the World as some will sometimes say Blaspheming But the Godly or God worshipping Man laying hold on Knowledge will despise or tread under all these things for though they be evil to other men yet to him all things are good And upon mature consideration he refers all things to Knowledge and that which is most to be wondered at he alone makes evil things good But I return again to my Discourse of Sense It is therefore a thing proper to Man to communicate and conjoin Sense and Understanding But every man as I said before cloth not enjoy Understanding for one man is material another essential And he that is material with wickedness as I said received from the Devils the Seed of Understanding but they that are with the Good essentially are saved with God For God is the Workman of all things and when he worketh he useth Nature He maketh all things good like himself But these things that are made good are in the use of Operation unlawful For the Motion of the World stirring up Generations makes Qualities infecting some with evilness and purifying some with good And the World Asclepius hath a peculiar Sense and Understanding not like to Man s nor so various or manifold but a better and more simple For this Sense and Understanding of the World is One in that it makes all things and unmakes them again into itself for it is the Organ or Instrument of the Will of God And it is so organized or framed and made for an Instrument by God that receiving all Seeds into itself from God and keeping them in itself it maketh all things effectually and dissolving them reneweth all things And therefore like a good Husband man of Life when things are dissolved or loosened he affords by the casting of Seed renovation to all things that grow There is nothing that it the World cloth not beget or bring forth alive and by its Motion it makes all things alive And it is at once both the Place and the Workman of Life But the Bodies are from the Matter in a different manner for some are of the Earth some of Water some of Air some of Fire and all are compounded but some are more compounded and some are more simple They that are compounded are the heavier and they that are less are the higher And the swiftness of the Motion of the World makes the varieties of the Qualities of Generation for the spiration or influence being most frequent extendeth unto the Bodies qualities with one fulness which is of Life Therefore God is the Father of the World but the World is the Father of things in the World And the World is the Son of God but things in the World are the Sons of the World And therefore it is well called the World that is an Ornament because it adorneth and beautifieth all things with the variety of Generation and indeficiency of Life which the unweariedness of Operation and the swiftness of Necessity with the mingling of Elements and the order of things done Therefore it is necessarily and properly called the World For of all living things both the Sense and the Understanding cometh into them from without inspired by that which compasseth them about and continueth them And the World receiving it once from God as soon as it was made hath it still What Ever it Once Had But God is not as it seems to some who Blaspheme through superstition without Sense and without Mind or Understanding For all things that are O Asclepius are in God and made by him and depend of him some working by Bodies some moving by a Soul like Essence some quickening by a Spirit and some receiving the things that are weary and all very fitly Or rather I say that he hath them not but I declare the Truth He is All Things not receiving them from without but exhibiting them outwardly And this is the Sense and Understanding of God to move all things always And there never shall be any time when any of those things that are shall fail or be wanting When I say the things that are I mean God for the things that are God hash and neither is there anything without him nor he without anything These things O Asclepius will appear to be true if thou understand them but if thou understand them not incredible For to understand is to believe but not to believe is not to understand For my speech or words reach not unto the Truth but the Mind is great and being led or conducted for a while by Speech is able to attain to the Truth And understanding all things round about and finding them consonant and agreeable to those things that were delivered and interpreted by Speech believeth and in that good belief resteth To them therefore that understand the things that have been said of God they are credible but to them that understand them not incredible And let these and thus many things be spoken concerning Understanding and Sense Tat Thou hast well explained these things Father Teach me furthermore these things for thou sayest that Science and Art were the Operations of the rational but now thou sayest that Beasts are unreasonable and for want of reason both are and are called Brutes so that by this Reason it must needs follow that unreasonable Creatures partake not of Science or Art because they come short of Reason Hermes It must needs be so Son Tat Why then O Father do we see some unreasonable living Creatures use both Science and Art as the Pismires treasure up for themselves food against the Winter and Fowls of the Air likewise make them Nests and four footed Beasts know their own Dens These things they do O Son not by Science or Art but by Nature for Science or Art are things that are taught but none of these brute Beasts are taught any of these things But these things being Natural unto them are wrought by Nature whereas Art and Science do not happen unto all but unto some As men are Musicians but not all neither are all Archers or Huntsmen or the rest but some of thenn have learned something by the working of Science or Art After the same manner also if some Pismires did so and some not thou mightest well say they gather their food according to Science and Art But seeing they are all led by Nature to the same thing even against their wills it is manifest they do not do it by Science or Art For Operations O Tat being unbodily are in Bodies and work by Bodies Wherefore O Tat in as much as they are unbodily thou must needs say they are immortal But in as much as they cannot act without Bodies I say they are always in a Body For those things that are to any thing or for the cause of any thing made subject to Providence or Necessity cannot possibly remain idle of their own proper Operation For that which is shall ever be for both the Body and the Life of it is the same And by this reason it follows that the Bodies also are always because I affirm That this corporiety is always by the Act and Operation or for them For although earthly bodies be subject to dissolution yet these bodies must be the Places and the Organs and Instruments of Acts or Operations But Acts or Operations are immortal and that which is immortal is always in Act and therefore also Corporification if it be always Acts or Operations do follow the Soul yet come not suddenly or promiscuously but some of them come together with being made man being about brutish or unreasonable things But the purer Operations do insensibly in the change of time work with the oblique part of the Soul And these Operations depend upon Bodies and truly they that are Corporifying come from the Divine Bodies into Mortal ones But every one of them acteth both about the Body and the Soul and are present with the Soul even without the Body And they are always Acts or Operations but the Soul is not always in a Mortal Body for it can be without a Body but Acts or Operations cannot be without Bodies This is a sacred speech Son the Body cannot Consist without a Soul Tat How meanest thou that Father Hermes Understand it thus O Tat When the Soul is separated from the Body there remaineth that same Body And this same Body according to the time of its abode is actuated or operated in that it is dissolved and becomes invisible And these things the Body cannot suffer without act or operation and consequently there remaineth with the Body the same act or operation This then is the difference between an Immortal Body and a Mortal one that the immortal one consists of one Matter and so doth not the mortal one and the immortal one doth but this suffereth And everything that acteth or operateth is stronger and ruleth but that which is actuated or operated is ruled And that which ruleth directeth and governeth as free but the other is ruled a servant Acts or Operations do not only actuate or operate living or breathing or insouled Bodies but also breathless Bodies or without Souls Wood and Stones and such like increasing and hearing fruit ripening corrupting rotting putrifying and breaking or working such like things and whatsoever inanimate Bodies can suffer Act or Operation O Son is called whatsoever is or is made or done and there are always many things made or rather all things For the World is never widowed or forsaken of any of those things that are but being always carried or moved in itself it is in labour to bring forth the things that are which shall never be left by it to corruption Let therefore every act or operation be understood to be always immortal in what manner of Body soever it be But some Acts or Operations be of Divine some of corruptible Bodies some universal some peculiar and some of the generals and some of the parts of every thing Divine Acts or Operations therefore there be and such as work or operate upon their proper Bodies and these also are perfect and being upon or in perfect Bodies Particular are they which work by any of the living Creatures Proper be they that work upon any of the things that are By this Discourse therefore O Son it is gathered that all things are full of Acts or Operations For if necessarily they be in every Body and that there be many Bodies in the World I may very well affirm that there be many other Acts or Operations For many times in one Body there is one and a second and a third besides these universal ones that follow And universal Operations I call them that are indeed bodily and are done by the Senses and Motions For without these it is impossible that the Body should consist But other Operations are proper to the Souls of Men by Arts Sciences Studies and Actions The Senses also follow these Operations or rather are the effects or perfections of them Understand therefore O Son the difference of Operations it is sent from above But sense being in the Body and having its essence from it when it receiveth Act or Operation manifesteth it making it as it were corporeal Therefore I say that the Senses are both corporeal and mortal having so much existence as the Body for they are born with the Body and die with it But mortal things themselves have not Sense as Not consisting of such an Essence For Sense can be no other than a corporeal apprehension either of evil or good that comes to the Body But to Eternal Bodies there is nothing comes nothing departs therefore there is no sense in them Tat Doth the Sense therefore perceive or apprehend in every Body Hermes In every Body O Son Tat And do the Acts or Operations work in all things Hermes Even in things inanimate O Son but there are differences of Senses For the Senses of things rational are with Reason of things unreasonable Corporeal only but the Senses of things inanimate are passive only according to Augmentation and Diminution But Passion and Sense depend both upon one head or height and are gathered together into the same by Acts or Operations But in living wights there be two other Operations that follow the Senses and Passions to wit Grief and Pleasure And without these it is impossible that a living wight especially a reasonable one should perceive or apprehend And therefore I say that these are the Ideas of Passions that bear rule especially in reasonable living wights The Operations work indeed but the Senses do declare and manifest the Operations and they being bodily are moved by the brutish parts of the Soul therefore I say they are both maleficial or doers of evil For that which affords the Sense to rejoice with Pleasure is straightway the cause of many evils happening to him that suffers it But Sorrows gives stronger torments and Anguish therefore doubtless are they both maleficial The same may be said of the Sense of the Soul Tat Is not the Soul incorporeal and the Sense a Body Father or is it rather in the Body Hermes If we put it in a Body O Son we shall make it like the Soul or the Operations for these being unbodily we say are in Bodies But Sense is neither Operation nor Soul nor anything else that belongs to the Body but as we have said and therefore it is not incorporeal And if it be not incorporeal it must needs be a Body for we always say that of things that are some are Bodies and some incorporeal Hermes Of Truth O Tat it is not possible that man being an imperfect wight compounded of imperfect Members and having his Tabernacle consisting of different and many Bodies should speak with any confidence But as far as it is possible and just I say That Truth is only in the Eternal Bodies whose very Bodies be also true The Fire is fire itself only and nothing else the Earth is earth itself and nothing else the air is air itself and nothing else the water water itself and nothing else But our Bodies consist of all these for they have of the Fire they have of the Earth they have of the Water and Air and yet there is neither Fire nor Earth nor Water nor Air nor anything true And if at the Beginning our Constitution had not Truth how could men either see the Truth or speak it or understand it only except God would All things therefore upon Earth O Tat are not Truth but imitations of the Truth and yet not all things neither for they are but few that are so But the other things are Falsehood and Deceit O Tat and Opinions like the Images of the fantasy or appearance And when the fantasy hath an influence from above then it is an imitation of Truth but without that operation from above it is left a lie And as an Image shews the Body described and yet is not the Body of that which is seen as it seems to be and it is seen to have eyes but it sees nothing and ears but hears nothing at all and all other things hath the picture but they are false deceiving the eyes of the beholder whilst they think they see the Truth and yet they are indeed but lies As many therefore as see not Falsehood see the Truth If therefore we do so understand and see every one of these things as it is then we see and understand true things But if we see or understand any thing besides or otherwise than that which is we shall neither understand nor know the Truth Tat Is Truth therefore upon Earth O Father Hermes Thou cost not miss the mark O Son Truth indeed is nowhere at all upon Earth O Tat for it cannot be generated or made But concerning the Truth it may be that some men to whom God will give the good seeing Power may understand it So that unto the Mind and reason there is nothing true indeed upon Earth But unto the True Mind and Reason all things are fantasies or appearances and opinions Tat Must we not therefore call it Truth to understand and speak the things that are Hermes But there is nothing true upon Earth Tat How then is this true That we do not know anything true how can that be done here Hermes O Son Truth is the most perfect Virtue and the highest Good itself not troubled by Matter not encompassed by a Body naked clear unchangeable venerable unalterable Good But the things that are here O Son are visible incapable of Good corruptible passible dissolvable changeable continually altered and made of another The things therefore that are not true to themselves how can they be true For every thing that is altered is a lie not abiding in what it is but being changed it shews us always other and other appearances Tat Is not man true O Father Hermes AS far forth as he is a Man he is not true Son for that which is true hath of itself alone its constitution and remains and abides according to itself such as it is But man consists of many things and doth not abide of himself but is turned and changed age after age Idea after Idea or form after form and this while he is yet in the Tabernacle And many have not known their own children after a little while and many children likewise have not known their own Parents Is it then possible O Tat that he who is so changed is not to be known should be true No on the contrary he is Falsehood being in many Appearances of changes But do thou understand the true to be that which abides the same and is Eternal but man is not ever therefore not True but man is a certain Appearance and Appearance is the highest Lie or Falsehood Tat But these Eternal Bodies Father are they not true though they be changed Hermes Everything that is begotten or made and changed is not true but being made by our Progenitor they might have had true Matter But these also have in themselves something that is false in regard of their change For nothing that remains not in itself is True Tat What shall one say then Father that only the Sun which besides the Nature of other things is not changed but abides in itself is Truth Hermes It is Truth and therefore is he only intrusted with the Workmanship of the World ruling and making all things whom I do both honour and adore his Truth and after the One and First I acknowledge him the Workman Tat What therefore doth thou affirm to be the first Truth O Father Hermes The One and Only O Tat that is not of Matter that is not in a body that is without Colour without Figure or Shape Immutable Unalterable which always is but Falsehood O Son is corrupted And corruption hath laid hold upon all things on Earth and the Providence of the True encompasseth and will encompass them For without corruption there can no Generation consist For Corruption followeth every Generation that it may again be generated For those things that are generated must of necessity be generated of those things that are corrupted and the things generated must needs be corrupted that the Generation of things being may not stand still or cease Acknowledge therefore the first Workman by the Generation of things Consequently the things that are generated of Corruption are false as being sometimes one thing sometimes another For it is impossible they should be made the same things again and that which is not the same how is it true Therefore O Son we must call these things fantasies or appearances And if we will give a man his right name we must call him the appearance of Manhood and a Child the fantasy or appearance of a Child an old man the appearance of an old man a young man the appearance of a young man and a man of ripe age the appearance of a man of ripe age For neither is a man a man nor a child a child nor a young man a young man nor an old man an old man But the things that pre exist and that are being changed are false These things understand thus O Son as these false Operations having their dependence from above even of the truth itself Which being so I do affirm that Falsehood is the Work of Truth Hermes We must now speak of the Soul and Body O Son after what manner the Soul is Immortal and what operation that is which constitutes the Body and dissolves it But in none of these is Death for it is a conception of a name which is either an empty word or else it is wrongly called Death by the taking away the first letter instead of Immortal Thanatos for Athanatos For Death is destruction but there is nothing in the whole world that is destroyed For if the World be a second God and an Immortal living Wight it is impossible that any part of an Immortal living Wight should die But all things that are in the World are members of the World especially Man the reasonable living Wight For the first of all is God the Eternal and Unmade and the Workman of all things The second is the World made by him after his own Image and by him holden together and nourished Snd immortalized and as from its own Father ever living So that as Immortal it is ever living and ever immortal For that which is ever living differs from that which is eternal For the Eternal was not begotten or made by another and if it were begotten or made yet it was made by itself not by any other but it is always made For the Eternal as it is Eternal is the Universe For the Father himself is Eternal of himself but the World was made by the Father ever living and immortal And as much Matter as there was laid up by him the Father made it all into a Body and swelling it made it round like a Sphere endued it with Quality being itself immortal and having Eternal Materiality The Father being full of Ideas sowed Qualities in the Sphere and shut them up as in a Circle deliberating to beautify with every Quality that which should afterwards be made Then clothing the Universal Body with Immortality lest the Matter if it would depart from this Composition should be dissolved into its own disorder For when the Matter was incorporeal O Son it was disordered and it hath here the same confusion daily revolved about other little things endued with Qualities in point of Augmentation and Diminution which men call Death being indeed a disorder happening about earthly living wights For the Bodies of Heavenly things have one order which they have received from the Father at the Beginning and is by the instauration of each of them kept indissolveable But the instauration of earthly Bodies is their consistence and their dissolution restores them into indissoluble that is Immortal And so there is made a privation of Sense but not a destruction of Bodies Now the third living wight is Man made after the Image of the World and having by the Will of the Father a Mind above other earthly wights And he hath not only a sympathy with the second God but also an understanding of the first For the second God he apprehends as a Body but the first he understands as Incorporeal and the Mind of the Good Tat And doth not this living Wight perish Hermes Speak advisedly O Son and learn what God is what the World what an Immortal Wight and what a dissolvable One is And understand that the World is of God and in God but Man of the World and in the World The Beginning and End and Consistence of all is God Because my Son Tat in thy absence would needs learn the Nature of the things that are He would not suffer me to give over as coming very young to the knowledge of every individual till I was forced to discourse to him many things at large that his contemplation might from point to point be more easy and successful But to thee I have thought good to write in few words choosing out the principal heads of the things then spoken and to interpret them more mystically because thou hast both more years and more knowledge of Nature All things that appear were made and are made Those things that are made are not made by themselves but by another And there are many things made but especially all things that appear and which are different and not like If the things that be made and done be made and done by another there must be one that must make and do them and he unmade and more ancient than the things that are made For I affirm the things that are made to be made by another and it is impossible that of the things that are made any should be more ancient than all but only that which is not made He is stronger and One and only knowing all things indeed as not having any thing more ancient than himself For he bears rule both over multitude and greatness and the diversity of the things that are made and the continuity of the Facture and of the Operation Moreover the things that are made are visible but he is invisible and for this cause he maketh them that he may be visible and therefore he makes them always Thus it is fit to understand and understanding to admire and admiring to think thy self happy that knowest thy natural Father For what is sweeter than a Natural Father Who therefore is this or how shall we know him Or is it just to ascribe unto him alone the Title and Appellation of God or of the Maker or of the Father or of all Three That of God because of his Power the Maker because of his Working and Operation and the Father because of his Goodness For Power is different from the things that are made but Act or Operation in that all things are made Wherefore letting go all much and vain talking we must understand these two things That Which is Made and Him Which is the Maker for there is nothing in the middle between these Two nor is there any third Therefore understanding All things remember these Two and think that these are All things putting nothing into doubt neither of the things above nor of the things below neither of things changeable nor things that are in darkness or secret For All things are but two Things That which Maketh and that which is Made and the One of them cannot depart or be divided from the Other For neither is it possible that the maker should be without the thing made for either of them is the self same thing therefore cannot the One of them be separated from the other no more than a thing can be separated from itself For if he that makes be nothing else but that which makes alone Simple Uncompounded it is of necessity that he makes the same thing to himself to whom it is the Generation of him that maketh to be also All that is made For that which is generated or made must necessarily be generated or made by another but without the Maker that which is made neither is made nor is for the one of them without the other hath lost his proper Nature by the privation of the other So if these Two be confessed That which maketh and that which is made then they are One in Union this going before and that following And that which goeth before is God the Maker and that which follows is that which is made be it what it will And let no man be afraid because of the variety of things that are made or done lest he should cast an aspersion of baseness or infamy upon God for it is the only Glory of him to do or make All things And this making or facture is as it were the Body of God and to him that maketh or doth there is nothing evil or filthy to be imputed or There is Nothing thought Evil or Filthy For these are Passions that follow Generation as Rust doth Copper or as Excrements do the Body But neither did the Copper smith make the Rust nor the Maker the Filth nor God the Evilness But the vicissitude of Generation doth make them as it were to blossom out and for this cause did make Change to be as one should say The Purgation of Generation Moreover is it lawful for the same Painter to make both Heaven and the Gods and the Earth and the Sea and Men and brute Beasts and inanimate Things and Trees and is it impossible for God to make these things O the great madness and ignorance of men in things that concern God For men that think so suffer that which is most ridiculous of all for professing to bless and praise God yet in not ascribing to him the making or doing of All things they know him not And besides their not knowing him they are extremely impious against him attributing unto him Passions as Pride or Oversight or Weakness or Ignorance or Envy For if he do not make or do all things he is either proud or not able or ignorant or envious which is impious to affirm For God hath only one Passion namely Good and he that is good is neither proud nor impotent nor the rest but God is Good itself For Good is all power to do or make all things and every thing that is made is made by God that is by the Good and that can make or do all things See then how he maketh all things and how the things are done that are done and if thou wilt learn thou mayest see an Image thereof very beautiful and like Look upon the Husbandman how he casteth Seeds into the Earth here Wheat there Barley and elsewhere some other Seeds Look upon the same Man planting a Vine or an Apple Tree or a Fig Tree or some other Tree So doth God in Heaven sow Immortality in the Earth Change in the whole Life and Motion And these things are not many but few and easily numbered for they are all but four God and Generation in which are all things ",

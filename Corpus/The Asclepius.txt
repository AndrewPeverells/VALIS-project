"ASCLEPIUS THE PERFECT SERMON OR THE ASCLEPIUS Trismegistus God O Asclepius hath brought thee unto us that thou mayest hear a Godly sermon a sermon such as well may seem of all the previous ones we’ve either uttered or with which we’ve been inspired by the Divine more Godly than the piety of ordinary faith If thou with eye of intellect shalt see this Word thou shalt in thy whole mind be filled quite full of all things good If that indeed the “many” be the “good ” and not the “one ” in which are “all ” Indeed the difference between the two is found in their agreement —“All” is of “One” or “One” is “All ” So closely bound is each to other that neither can be parted from its mate But this with diligent attention shalt thou learn from out the sermon that shall follow this But do thou O Asclepius go forth a moment and call in the one who is to hear And when he had come in Asclepius proposed that Ammon too should be allowed to come Thereon Thrice greatest said Tris There is no cause why Ammon should be kept away from us For we remember how we have ourselves set down in writing many things to his address as though unto a son most dear and most beloved of physics many things of ethics too as many as could be It is however with thy name I will inscribe this treatise But call I prithee no one else but Ammon lest a most pious sermon on a so great theme be spoilt by the admission of the multitude For ’tis the mark of an unpious mind to publish to the knowledge of the crowd a tractate brimming o’er with the full Greatness of Divinity When Ammon too had come within the holy place and when the sacred group of four was now complete with piety and with God’s goodly presence—to them sunk in fit silence reverently their souls and minds pendent on Hermes’ lips thus Love Divine began to speak Tris The soul of every man O my Asclepius is deathless yet not all in like fashion but some in one way or one time some in another Asc Is not then O Thrice greatest one each soul of one and the same quality Tris How quickly hast thou fallen O Asclepius from reason’s true sobriety Did not I say that “All” is “One ” and “One” is “All ” in as much as all things have been in the Creator before they were created Nor is He called unfitly “All ” in that His members are the “All ” Therefore in all this argument see that thou keep in mind Him who is “One” “All ” or who Himself is maker of the “All ” All things descend from Heaven to Earth to Water and to Air ’Tis Fire alone in that it is borne upwards giveth life that which is carried downwards is subservient to Fire Further whatever doth descend from the above begetteth what floweth upwards nourisheth ’Tis Earth alone in that it resteth on itself that is Receiver of all things and also the Restorer of all genera that it receives This Whole therefore as thou rememberest in that it is of all —in other words all things embraced by nature under “Soul” and “World ” are in perpetual flux so varied by the multiform equality of all their forms that countless kinds of well distinguished qualities may be discerned yet with this bond of union that all should seem as One and from “One” “All ” That then from which the whole Cosmos is formed consisteth of Four Elements—Fire Water Earth and Air Cosmos itself is one its Soul is one and God is one Now lend to me the whole of thee all that thou can’st in mind all that thou skill’st in penetration For that the Reason of Divinity may not be known except by an intention of the senses like to it ’Tis likest to the torrent’s flood down dashing headlong from above with all devouring tide so that it comes about that by the swiftness of its speed it is too quick for our attention not only for the hearers but also for the very teachers ",

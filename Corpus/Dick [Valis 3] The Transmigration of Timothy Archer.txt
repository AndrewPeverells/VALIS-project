"BAREFOOT CONDUCTS HIS seminars on his houseboat in Sausalito It costs a hundred dollars to find out why we are on this Earth You also get a sandwich but I wasn t hungry that day John Lennon had just been killed and I think I know why we are on this Earth it s to find out that what you love the most will be taken away from you probably due to an error in high places rather than by design After I parked my Honda Civic in the metered slot I sat listening to the radio Already all the Beatles songs ever written could be heard on every frequency Shit I thought I feel like I'm back in the Sixties still married to Jefferson Archer Where s Gate Five I asked two hippies going by They didn t answer I wondered if they d heard the news about John Lennon I wondered then what the hell I cared about Arabic mysticism about the Sufis and all that other stuff that Edgar Barefoot talked about on his weekly radio program on KPFA in Berkeley The Sufis are a happy lot They teach that the essence of God isn t power or wisdom or love but beauty That s a totally new idea in the world unknown to Jews and Christians I am neither I still work at the Musik Shop on Telegraph Avenue in Berkeley and I'm trying to make the payments on the house that Jeff and I bought when we were married I got the house and Jeff got nothing That was the story of his life Why would anybody in their right mind care about Arabic mysticism I asked myself as I locked up my Honda and started toward the line of boats Especially on a nice day But what the fuck I had already made the drive over the Richardson Bridge through Richmond which is tawdry and then past the refineries The bay is beautiful The police clock you on the Richardson Bridge they time when you pay your toll and when you leave the bridge on the Marin side If you arrive in Marin County too soon it costs you big bucks I never cared for the Beatles Jeff brought home Rubber Soul and I told him it was insipid Our marriage was breaking up and I date it from hearing Michelle one billion times day after day That would be roughly around I guess A lot of people in the Bay Area date events by the release of Beatles records Paul McCartney s first solo album came out the year before Jeff and I separated If I hear Teddy Boy I start crying That was the year I lived in our house alone don't do it don't live alone Right up to the end Jeff had his antiwar activity to keep him company I withdrew and listened to KPFA playing baroque music better left forgotten That was how I first heard Edgar Barefoot who impressed me initially as a jerk off with his little voice and that tone of savoring his own cerebral activity immensely delighting like a two year old in each successive satori There is evidence that I was the only person in the Bay Area who felt that way I changed my mind later KPFA started broadcasting Barefoot s taped lectures late at night and I would listen while I tried to get to sleep When you're half asleep all that monotonous intoning makes sense Several people explained to me once that subliminal messages had been inserted in all the programs aired in the Bay Area around almost certainly by Martians The message I got from listening to Barefoot seemed to be You are actually a good person and you shouldn t let anyone else determine your life Anyhow I got to sleep more and more readily as time passed I forgot Jeff and the light that had gone out when he died except that now and then an incident would pop into existence in my mind usually regarding some crisis in the Co op on University Avenue Jeff used to get into fights in the Co op I thought it was funny So now I realized as I walked up the gangplank onto Edgar Barefoot s cushy houseboat I will date my going to this seminar by John Lennon s murder the two events are for me of a seamless whole What a way to start understanding I thought Go back home and smoke a number Forget the wimpy voice of enlightenment this is a time of guns you can do nothing enlightened or otherwise you are a record clerk with a degree in liberal arts from Cal The best lack all conviction something like that What rough beast slouches towards Bethlehem to be born A creature with bad posture nightmare of the world We had a test on Yeats I got an A minus I was good I used to be able to sit on the floor all day eating cheese and drinking goat s milk figuring out the longest novel I have read all the long novels I graduated from Cal I live in Berkeley I read The Remembrance of Things Past and I remember nothing I came out the door I went in as the saying goes It did me no good all those years in the library waiting for my number to light up signifying that my book had been carried to the desk That s true for a lot of people most likely But those remain in my mind as good years in which we had more cunning than is generally recognized we knew exactly what we had to do the Nixon regime had to go we did what we did deliberately and none of us regrets it Jeff Archer is dead now John Lennon is dead as of today Other dead people lie along the path as if something fairly large passed by Maybe the Sufis with their conviction about God s innate beauty can make me happy maybe this is why I am marching up the gangplank to this plush houseboat a plan is fulfilled in which all the sad deaths add up to something instead of noth­ing somehow get converted to joy A terribly thin kid who resembled our friend Joe the junkie stopped me saying Ticket You mean this thing From my purse I got out the printed card that Barefoot had mailed me upon receipt of my hundred dollars In California you buy enlightenment the way you buy peas at the supermarket by size and by weight I d like four pounds of enlightenment I said to myself No better make that ten pounds I'm really running short Go to the rear of the boat the skinny youth said And you have a nice day I said When one catches sight of Edgar Barefoot for the first time one says He fixes car transmissions He stands about five six and because he weighs so much you get the impression that he survives on junk food by and large hamburgers He is bald For this area of the world at this time in human civilization he dresses all wrong he wears a long wool coat and the most ordinary brown pants and blue cotton shirt but his shoes appear to be expensive I don't know if you can call that thing around his neck a tie They tried to hang him perhaps and he proved too heavy he broke the rope and continued on about his business Enlightenment and survival are intermingled I said to myself as I took a seat cheap folding chairs and al­ready a few people here and there mostly young My husband is dead and his father is dead his father s mistress ate a mason jar of barbiturates and is in the grave perpetually asleep which was the whole point of doing it It sounds like a chess game the bishop is dead and with him the blond Norwegian woman who he supported by means of the Bishop s Discretionary Fund according to Jeff a chess game and a racket These are strange times now but those were far stranger Edgar Barefoot standing before us motioned us to change seats to sit up front I wondered what would happen if I lit a cigarette I once lit a cigarette in an ashram after a lecture on the Vedas Mass loathing descended on me plus a sharp dig in the ribs I had outraged the lofty The strange thing about the lofty is that they die just like the common Bishop Timothy Archer owned a whole lot of loftiness by weight and by size and it did him no good he lies like the rest underground So much for spiritual things So much for aspirations He sought Jesus Moreover he sought what lies behind Jesus the real truth Had he been content with the phony he would still be alive That is something to ponder Lesser people accepting falsehood are alive to tell about it they did not perish in the Dead Sea Desert The most famous bishop of modern times bit the big one because he mistrusted Jesus There is a lesson there So perhaps I have enlightenment I know not to doubt I know also to take more than two bottles of Coca Cola with me when I drive out into the wastelands ten thousand miles from home Using a gas station map as if I am still in down­town San Francisco It s fine for locating Portsmouth Square but not so fine for locating the genuine source of Christianity hidden from the world these twenty two hundred years I will go home and smoke a number I said to myself This is a waste of time from the moment John Lennon died every­thing has been a waste of time including mourning over it I have given up mourning for Lent that is I cease to grieve Raising his hands to us Barefoot began to talk I little noted what he said neither did I long remember as the expression goes The horse s ass was me for paying a hundred dollars to listen to this the man before us was the smart one because he got to keep the money we got to give it That is how you calculate wisdom by who pays I teach this I should instruct the Sufis and the Christians as well especially the Episcopa­lian bishops with their funds Front me a hundred bucks Tim Imagine calling the bishop Tim Like calling the pope George or Bill like the lizard in Alice I think Bill de­scended the chimney as I recall It is an obscure reference like what Barefoot is saying it is little noted and no one re­members it Death in life Barefoot said and life in death two mo­dalities like yin and yang of one underlying continuum Two faces a holon as Arthur Koestler terms it You should read Janus Each passes into the other as a joyous dance It is Lord Krishna who dances in us and through us we are all Sri Krishna who if you remember comes in the form of time That is his real universal shape Ultimate form destroyer of all people of everything that is He smiled at us all with beatific pleasure Only in the Bay Area I thought would this nonsense be tolerated A two year old addresses us Christ how foolish it all is I feel my old distaste the angry aversion we cultivate in Berkeley that Jeff enjoyed so His pleasure was to get angry at every trifle Mine is to endure nonsense At financial cost I am terribly frightened of death I thought Death has de­stroyed me it isn t Sri Krishna destroyer of all people it is death destroyer of my friends It singled them out and left everyone else undisturbed Fucking death I thought You homed in on those I love You utilized their folly and pre­vailed You took advantage of foolish people which is truly unkind Emily Dickinson was full of shit when she prattled about kindly Death that s an abominable thought that death is kind She never saw a six car pile up on the EastshoreFreeway Art like theology a packaged fraud Downstairs the people are fighting while I look for God in a reference book God ontological arguments for Better yet practical argu­ments against There is no such listing It would have helped a lot if it had come in time arguments against being foolish ontological and empirical ancient and modern see common sense The trouble with being educated is that it takes a long time it uses up the better part of your life and when you are finished what you know is that you would have benefited more by going into banking I wonder if bankers ask such questions They ask what the prime rate is up to today If a banker goes out on the Dead Sea Desert he probably takes a flare pistol and canteens and C rations and a knife Not a crucifix display­ing a previous idiocy that was intended to remind him De­stroyer of the people on the Eastshore Freeway and my hopes besides Sri Krishna you got us all Good luck in your other endeavors Insofar as they are equally commendable in the eyes of other gods I am faking it I thought These passions are bilge I have become inbred from hanging around the Bay Area intellec­tual community I think as I talk pompously and in riddles I am not a person but a self admonishing voice Worse I talk as I hear Garbage in as the computer science majors say gar­bage out I should stand up and ask Mr Barefoot a meaning­less question and then go home while he is phrasing the perfect answer That way he wins and I get to leave We both gain He does not know me I do not know him except as a sententious voice It ricochets in my head I thought already and it s just begun this is the first lecture of many Sententious twaddle the name of the Archer family s black retainer in perhaps a TV sitcom Sententious you get your black ass in here you hear me What this droll little man is saying is important he is discussing Sri Krishna and how men die This is a topic that I from personal experience deem significant I should know because it is familiar to me it showed up in my life years ago and will not go away Once we owned a little old farm house The wiring shorted out when someone plugged in a toaster During rainy weather water dripped from the light bulb in the kitchen ceiling Jeff every now and then poured a coffee can of black tarlike stuff onto the roof to stop it from leaking we could not afford the ninety weight paper The tar did no good Our house belonged with others like it in the flat part of Berkeley on San Pablo Avenue near Dwight Way The good part was that Jeff and I could walk to the Bad Luck Restaurant and look at Fred Hill the KGB agent some said who fixed the salads and owned the place and decided whose pictures got hung up for free exhibition When Fred came to town years ago all the Party members in the Bay Area froze solid out of fear this was the tip off that a Soviet hatchetman was in the vicinity It also told you who belonged to the Party and who did not Fear reigned among the dedicated but no one else cared It was like the eschatological judge sorting the sheep the faithful from among the ordinary others except in this case it was the sheep who quaked Dreams of poverty excited universal enjoyment in Berkeley coupled with the hope that the political and economic situa­tion would worsen throwing the country into ruin this was the theory of the activists Misfortune so vast that it would wreck everyone responsible and not responsible alike sinking into defeat We were then and we are now totally crazy It s literate to be crazy For example you would have to be crazy to name your daughter Goneril Like they taught us at the English Department at Cal madness was funny to the patrons of the Globe Theater It is not funny now At home you are a great artist but here you are just the author of a difficult book about Here Comes Everybody Big deal I thought With a drawing in the margin of someone thumbing his nose And for that like this speech now we paid good money You d think having been poor so long would have taught me better sharp­ened my wits as it were My instinct for self preservation I am the last living person who knew Bishop Timothy Archer of the Diocese of California his mistress his son my husband the homeowner and wage earner pro forma Some­body should well it would be nice if no one went the way they collectively went volunteering to die each of them like Parsifal a perfect fool DEAR JANE MARION Within a period of two days two people one an editor friend the other a writer friend recommended The Green Cover to me both of them saying the same thing in effect that if I wanted to know what was happening in contemporary literature I had god­damn well better know your work When I got the book home I had been told that the titular essay was the best and to start with it I realized that you had herein done a piece on Tim Archer So I read that All of a sudden he was alive again my friend It brings fierce pain to me not joy I can t write about him since I'm not a writer although I did major in English at Cal anyhow one day as a sort of exercise I sat down and scratched out a spurious dialog between him and me to see if I could by any chance recapture the cadence of his endless flow of talk I found I could do it but like Tim himself it was dead People ask me sometimes what he was like but I'm not into Christianity so I don't encounter church people that often al­though I used to My husband was his son Jeff so I knew Tim on a rather personal basis Frequently we talked theology At the time of Jeff s suicide I met Tim and Kirsten at the airport in San Francisco they were briefly back from England and meeting with the official translators of the Zadokite Documents at which point in his life Tim first began to believe that Christ was a fraud and that the Zadokite Sect possessed the true religion He asked me how he should go about conveying this news to his flock This was before Santa Barbara He kept Kirsten in a plain apartment in the Tenderloin District of the City Very few people went there Jeff and I of course could I remember when Jeff first introduced me to his father Tim walked up to me and said My name s Tim Archer He didn t mention he was a bishop He did have on the ring though I'm the one who got the phone call about Kirsten s suicide We were still suffering over Jeff s suicide I had to stand there and listen to Tim telling me that Kirsten had just slipped away I could see my little brother who had really been fond of Kirsten he was assembling a balsawood model of a Spad Thirteen he knew the call was from Tim but of course he didn t know that now Kirsten along with Jeff was dead Tim differed from everyone else I ever knew in these respects he could believe in anything and he would immediately act on the basis of his new belief that is until he ran into another belief and then he acted on that He was convinced for example that a medium had cured Kirsten s son s mental problems which were severe One day watching Tim on TV being interviewed by David Frost I realized that he was talking about me and Jeff however there was no real relationship between what he was saying and the reality situation Jeff was watching too he did not know that his father was talking about him Like the Medieval Realists Tim believed that words were actual things If you could put it into words it was de facto true This is what cost him his life I wasn t in Israel when he died but I can visualize him out on the desert studying the map the way he looked at a gas station map in downtown San Francisco The map said that if you drove X miles you would arrive at place Y whereupon he would start up the car and drive X miles knowing that Y would be there it said so on the map The man who doubted every article of Christian doctrine believed everything he saw written down But the incident that for me conveyed the most about him took place in Berkeley one day Jeff and I were supposed to meet Tim at a particular corner at a particular time Tim drove up late Running after him came a gas station attendant furiously angry Tim had filled up at this man s station and then backed over a pump mashing it flat whereupon Tim had driven off because he was late for his appointment with us You destroyed my pump the attendant yelled totally out of breath and totally beside himself I can call the police You just drove off I had to run all the way after you What I wanted to see was whether Tim would tell this man a very angry but really a very modest man in the social order a man at the bottom of the scale on which Tim really stood at the top I wanted to see if Tim would inform him that he was the Bishop of the Diocese of California and was known all over the world a friend of Martin Luther King Jr a friend of Robert Kennedy a great and famous man who wasn t at the moment wearing his clericals Tim did not He humbly apologized It became evident to the gas station attendant after a bit that he was dealing with someone for whom large brightly colored metal pumps did not exist he was dealing with a man who was quite literally living in another world That other world was what Tim and Kirsten called The Other Side and step by step that Other Side drew them all to it first Jeff then Kirsten and ineluctably Tim himself Sometimes I tell myself that Tim still exists but totally now in that other world How does Don McLean put it in his song Vincent This world was never meant for one as beautiful as you That s my friend this world was never really real to him so I guess it wasn t the right world for him a mistake got made somewhere and underneath he knew it When I think about Tim I think And still I dream he treads the lawn Walking ghostly in the dew Pierced by my glad singing through As Yeats put it Thank you for your piece on Tim but it hurt to find him alive again for a moment I guess that is the measure of greatness in a piece of writing that it can do that I believe it was in one of Aldous Huxley s novels that a character phones up another character and exclaims excitedly I ve just found a mathematical proof for the existence of God Had it been Tim he would have found another proof the next day contravening the first and would have believed that just as readily It was as if he was in a garden of flowers and each flower was new and different and he discovered each in turn and was equally delighted by each but then forgot the ones that came before He was totally loyal to his friends Those he never forgot Those were his permanent flowers The strange part Ms Marion is that in a way I miss him more than I miss my husband Maybe he made more of an impression on me I don't know Perhaps you can tell me you're the writer Cordially Angel Archer I wrote that to the famous New York Literary Establishment author Jane Marion whose essays appear in the best of the little magazines I did not expect an answer and I got none Maybe her publisher to whom I sent it read it and flipped it away I don't know Marion s essay on Tim had infuriated me it was based entirely on secondhand information Marion never knew Tim but she wrote about him anyhow She said something about Tim giving up friendships when it served his purpose or something like that Tim never gave up a friendship in his life That appointment that Jeff and I had made with the bishop was an important one In two respects official and as it turned out unofficial Regarding the official aspect I proposed and intended to carry off a meeting a merger between Bishop Archer and my friend Kirsten Lundborg who represented FEM in the Bay Area The Female Emancipation Movement wanted Tim to make a speech on its behalf a speech for free As the wife of the bishop s son it was thought I could pull it off Needless to say Tim did not seem to understand the situation but that was not his fault neither Jeff nor I had clued him in Tim supposed we were getting together to have a meal at the Bad Luck which he had heard about Tim would be paying for the meal because we didn t have any money at all that year or for that matter the year before As a clerical typist in a law office on Shattuck Avenue I was the putative wage earner The law office consisted of two Berkeley guys active in all the protest movements They defended in cases involving drugs Their firm was called BARNES AND GLEASON LAW OFFICE AND CANDLE SHOP they sold handmade candles or at least displayed them It was Jerry Barnes way of insulting his own profession and making it clear that he had no intention of bringing in any money Regarding this goal he was successful I remember one time a grateful client paid him in opium a black stick that looked like a bar of unsweetened chocolate Jerry was at a loss as to what to do with it He wound up giving it away It was interesting to watch Fred Hill the KGB agent greeting all his customers the way a good restaurateur does shaking hands and smiling Hill had cold eyes According to the talk on the street he had the authority to murder those under Party discipline who seemed restive Tim paid hardly any attention to Fred Hill as the son of a bitch led us to a table I wondered what the Bishop of California would say if he knew that the man handing us our menus was a Russian national here in the U S under a fake name an officer in the Soviet secret police Or perhaps this was all a Berkeley myth As in the many preceding years Berkeley and paranoia were bedfellows The end of the Vietnam War was a long way off Nixon had yet to pull out U S forces Watergate still lay several years ahead Government agents rooted about the Bay Area We independent activists suspected everyone of conniving we trusted neither the right nor the CP USA If there was any single hated thing in Berkeley it was the smell of the police Hello folks Fred Hill said The soup today is minestrone Would you like a glass of wine while you decide The three of us said we wanted wine just so long as it wasn t Gallo and Fred Hill went off to get it He s a colonel in the KGB Jeff said to the bishop Very interesting Tim said scrutinizing the menu They re really underpaid I said That would be why he has opened up a restaurant Tim said looking around him at the other tables and patrons I wonder if they have Black Sea caviar here Glancing up at me he said Do you like caviar Angel The roe of the sturgeon although they do sometimes pass off the roe of Cyclopterus lumpus as caviar however that is generally of a reddish hue and larger It is much cheaper I don't care for it lumpfish caviar I mean In a sense to say lumpfish caviar is an oxymoron He laughed mostly to himself Shit I thought What s wrong Jeff said I'm just wondering where Kirsten is I said I looked at my watch The bishop said The origins of the feminist movement can be found in Lysistrata We must refrain from all touch of baubled love Again he laughed With bolts and bars our orders flout and He paused as if considering whether to go on And shut us out It s a pun Shut us out refers both to the general situation of noncompliance and a shutting up of the vagina Dad Jeff said we re trying to figure out what to order Okay The bishop said If you mean we re trying to decide what to have to eat my remark is certainly applicable Aristophanes would have appreciated that Come on Jeff said Carrying a tray Fred Hill returned Louis Martini burgundy He set down three glasses If you ll excuse my asking aren't you Bishop Archer The bishop nodded You marched with Dr King at Selma Hill said Yes I was at Selma the bishop said I said Tell him your vagina joke To Fred Hill I said The bishop knows a real old vagina joke Chuckling Bishop Archer said The joke is old she means don't misunderstand syntactically Dr King was a great man Fred Hill said He was a very great man the bishop said I ll have the sweetbreads That s a good choice Fred Hill said jotting Also let me recommend the pheasant I ll have the veal Oscar I said So will I Jeff said He seemed moody I knew that he objected to my using my friendship with the bishop in order to get a free speech for FEM or any other group He knew how easily free speeches got tugged out of his father Both he and the bishop wore dark wool business suits and of course Fred Hill famous KGB agent and mass killer wore a suit and tie I wondered that day sitting there with the two of them in their business suits if Jeff would go into Holy Orders as his father had both men looked solemn bringing to the task of ordering dinner the same intensity the same gravity that they brought to so much else the professional stance oddly punctuated on the bishop s part with wit although like today the wit never struck me as quite right As we spooned up our minestrone soup Bishop Archer talked about his forthcoming heresy trial It was a subject he found endlessly fascinating Certain Bible Belt bishops were out to get him because he had said in several published articles and in his sermons preached at Grace Cathedral that no one had seen hide nor hair of the Holy Ghost since apostolic times This had caused Tim to conclude that the doctrine of the Trinity was incorrect If the Holy Ghost was in fact a form of God equal to Yahweh and Christ surely he would still be with us Speaking in tongues did not impress him He had seen a lot of it in his years in the Episcopal Church and it struck him as autosuggestion and dementia Further a scrupulous reading of Acts disclosed that at Pentecost when the Holy Ghost descended on the disciples giving them the gift of speech they had spoken in foreign languages which people nearby had understood This is not glossolalia as the term is now used this is xenoglossy The bishop as we ate chortled over Peter s deft response to the charge that the Eleven were drunk Peter had said in a loud voice to the scoffing crowd that it was not likely that the Eleven were drunk inasmuch as it was only nine A M The bishop pondered out loud between spoonfuls of minestrone soup that the course of Western history might have been changed if the time had been nine P M instead of nine A M Jeff looked bored and I kept consulting my watch wondering what was keeping Kirsten Probably she had gone in to have her hair done She fussed forever with her blond hair especially in anticipation of momentous occasions The Episcopal Church is Trinitarian you cannot be a priest or bishop of that church if you do not absolutely accept and teach that well it s called the Nicene Creed And I believe in the Holy Ghost the Lord and Giver of Life Who proceedeth from the Father and the Son Who with the Father and the Son together is worshipped and glorified So Bishop McClary back in Missouri was correct Tim had in fact committed heresy However Tim had been a practicing lawyer before he became a rector of the Episcopal Church He relished the oncoming heresy trial Bishop McClary knew his Bible and he knew canon law but Tim would blow golden smoke rings around him until McClary would not know up from down Tim knew this In facing a heresy trial he was in his element Moreover he was writing a book about it he would win and in addition he would make some money Every newspaper in America had carried articles and even editorials on the subject Successfully trying someone for heresy in the s was really difficult Listening to Tim dilate endlessly the thought came to me that he had calculatedly committed heresy in order to bring on the trial At least he had done it unconsciously It was as the term has it a good career move The so called gift of speech the bishop said cheerfully reverses the unity of language lost when the Tower of Babel was attempted that is its construction was attempted When the day comes that someone in my congregation gets up and talks Walloon well that day I will believe that the Holy Ghost exists I'm not sure he ever existed The apostolic conception of the Holy Spirit is based on the Hebrew ruah the spirit of God For one thing this spirit is female not male She speaks concerning the Messianic expectation Christianity appropriated the notion from Judaism and when Christianity had converted a sufficient number of pagans Gentiles if you will it abandoned the concept since it was only meaningful to the Jews anyhow To the Greek converts it made no sense whatsoever although Socrates declared that he had an inner voice or daemon that guided him a tutelary spirit not to be confused with the English word demon which of course refers to an indubitably evil spirit The two terms are often confused Do I have time for a cocktail They just have beer and wine here I said I d like to make a phone call the bishop said he dabbed at his chin with his napkin rising to his feet and glancing about Is there a public phone There s a phone at the Chevron station Jeff said But if you go back there you ll trash another pump I simply do not understand how that happened the bishop said I never felt anything or saw anything the first I knew was when Albers I have his name written down When he showed up in hysteria Perhaps that was a manifestation of the Holy Ghost I hope my insurance hasn t lapsed It s always a good idea to carry automobile insurance I said That wasn t Walloon he was speaking Yes well Tim said it also wasn t intelligible It may well have been glossolalia for all I know Maybe there is evidence that the Holy Ghost is here He reseated himself Are we waiting for something he asked me You keep looking at your watch I only have an hour then I have to get back to the City The difficulty that dogma presents is that it strickens the creative spirit in man Whitehead Alfred North White head has given us the idea of God in process and he is or was a major scientist Process theology It all goes back to Jakob Boehme and his no yes deity his dialectic deity anticipating Hegel Boehme based that on Augustine Sic et non you know Latin lacks a precise word for yes I suppose sic is the closest although by and large sic is more correctly rendered as so or hence or in that manner Quod si hoc nunc sic incipiam Nihil est Quod si sic Tantumdem egero Et sic He paused frowning Nihil est In a distributive language English is the best example that would literally mean nothing exists Of course what Terence means is it is nothing with id or it understood Still there is an enormous thrust in the two word utterance nihil est The amazing power of Latin to compress meaning into the fewest possible words That and precision are the two most admirable qualities of it by far English however has the greater vocabulary Dad Jeff said we re waiting for a friend of Angel s I told you about her the other day Non video the bishop said I'm saying that I don't see her the her being understood Look that man is going to take a picture of us Fred Hill carrying an SLR camera with flash attachment approached our table Your Grace would it be all right with you if I took your picture Let me take a picture of you two together I said standing up You can put it on the wall I said to Fred Hill That would be fine with me Tim said During the meal Kirsten Lundborg joined us She looked unhappy and fatigued and she could find nothing on the menu that pleased her She wound up drinking a glass of white wine eating nothing saying very little but smoking one cigarette after another Her face showed lines of strain We did not know it then but she had mild and chronic peritonitis which can be and was very soon for her very serious She hardly seemed aware of us I assumed she had gone into one of her periodic depressions I had no idea that day that she was physically ill You could probably get toast and a soft boiled egg Jeff said No Kirsten shook her head My body is trying to die she said presently She did not elaborate We all felt uncomfortable I suppose that was the idea in her mind Perhaps not Bishop Archer gazed at her attentively and with a great deal of sympathy I wondered if he intended to suggest a laying on of hands They do that in the Episcopal Church The recovery rate due to that is not recorded anywhere that I know of which is just as well She spoke mostly about her son Bill who had been turned down by the Army for psychological reasons This seemed both to please her and to annoy her I'm surprised to learn you have a son old enough to be inducted the bishop said For a moment Kirsten was silent Some of the worry that marred her features eased It was evident to me that Tim s remark cheered her At this point in her life she was a rather good looking woman but a perpetual severity marred her in terms of her looks and in terms of the emotional impression that she presented As much as I admired her I knew that Kirsten could never turn down the chance to offer up a cruel remark a defect that she had in fact honed into a talent The idea seems to be that if you are clever enough you can insult people and they will sit still for it but if you are clumsy and dumb you can get away with nothing It all has to do with your verbal skills You are judged like contest entries on aptness of phrase Bill is only physically that old Kirsten said But she looked happier now What is it that comic said the other night on Johnny Carson My wife doesn t go to a plastic surgeon she wants the real thing I just had my hair done that s why I was late One time just before I had to fly over to France they did my hair so that She smiled I looked like Bozo the Clown The whole time I was in Paris I wore a babushka I told everyone I was on my way to Notre Dame What s a babushka Jeff asked Bishop Archer said A Russian peasant Regarding him intently Kirsten said That s true I must have the wrong word You have the right word the bishop said The term for the cloth worn about the head derives Aw Christ Jeff said Kirsten smiled She sipped her white wine I understand you're a member of FEM the bishop said I am FEM Kirsten said She s one of the founders I said You know I have very strong views about abortion the bishop said You know Kirsten said I have too What are yours We feel that the unborn have rights invested in them not by man but by Almighty God the bishop said The right to take a human life is denied back to the Decalogue Let me ask you this Kirsten said Do you think a human being has rights after he or she is dead I beg your pardon the bishop said Well Kirsten said you're granting them rights before they re born why not grant them equal rights after they re dead As a matter of fact they do have rights after they re dead Jeff said You need a court order to use a cadaver or organs taken from a cadaver for I'm trying to eat this veal Oscar I interrupted seeing an endless line of argumentation ahead and emerging from it Bishop Archer s refusal to make a free speech for FEM Can we talk about something else Fazed not at all Jeff continued I know a guy who works for the coroner s office He told me one time they went into the intensive care ward at well I forget which hospital any how this woman had just died and they went in and ripped her eyes out for a transplant before the monitors had stopped registering vital signs He said it happens all the time We sat for a time Kirsten sipping her wine the rest of us eating however Bishop Archer had not stopped gazing at Kirsten with sympathy and concern It came to me later but not at the time that he sensed that she was latently physically ill sensed what the rest of us had missed Perhaps it emanated from his pastoral ministering but I saw him do this again and again discern a need in someone when no one else sometimes even the person involved recognized it or if they recognized it took time to pause and care I have the highest regard for FEM he said in a gentle voice Most people do Kirsten said but now she seemed genuinely pleased Does the Episcopal Church allow the ordination of women For the priesthood the bishop said It hasn t come yet but it is coming Then I take it you personally approve Certainly He nodded I have taken an active interest in modernizing the standards for male and female deacons for one I will not allow the term deaconess to be used in my diocese I insist that both male and female deacons be referred to as deacons The standardization of educational and training bases for male and female deacons will make it possible later on to ordain female deacons to the priesthood I see this as inevitable and I am working actively for it Well I am really pleased to hear you say this Kirsten said Then you differ markedly from the Catholic Church She set down her wine glass The pope The Bishop of Rome Bishop Archer said That is what he actually is the Bishop of Rome The Roman Catholic Church our church is a catholic church as well They won t ever ordain women you think Kirsten said Only when the Parousia is here Bishop Archer said What is that Kirsten said You ll have to excuse my ignorance I really have no religious background or inclinations Neither do I Bishop Archer said I only know that as Malebranche said It is not I who breathes but God who breathes in me The Parousia is the Presence of Christ The catholic church of which we are a part breathes and breathes only through the living power of Christ he is the head of which we are the body Now the Church is his body he is the head as Paul said It is a concept known to the ancient world and one we can understand Interesting Kirsten said No it is true the bishop said Intellectual matters are interesting and so are odd factual things such as the amount of salt produced by a single mine This that I speak of is a topic that determines not what we know but what we are We have our life through Jesus Christ He is the image of the unseen God and the first born of all creation for in him were created all things in heaven and on earth everything visible and everything invisible Thrones Dominations Sovereignties Powers all things were created through him and for him Before anything was created he existed and he holds all things in unity The bishop s voice was low and intense he spoke evenly and as he spoke he gazed directly at Kirsten and I saw her return his gaze in almost a stricken way as if she both wanted to hear and did not want to hear fearing and fascinated Many times I had heard Tim preach at Grace Cathedral and he now addressed her one person with the same intensity that he brought to bear on great masses of people And yet it was all for her There was silence for a moment A lot of the priests still say deaconess Jeff said He shuffled awkwardly When Tim isn t around I said to Kirsten Bishop Archer is probably the strongest supporter of women s rights in the Episcopal Church Actually I think I ve heard that Kirsten said She turned to me and said calmly I wonder do you suppose I d be glad to address your organization the bishop said That s why we re having lunch Reaching into his coat pocket he brought out his black notebook I ll take your phone number and I promise to call you within the next few days I ll have to consult with Jonathan Graves the bishop suffragan but I'm sure I ll be able to find time for you I ll give you both my number at FEM Kirsten said and my home phone number Do She hesitated Do you want me to tell you something about FEM Bishop Tim Bishop Archer said We are not militant in the conventional sense of I'm quite familiar with your organization Bishop Archer said I want you to consider this If I have all the eloquence of men or of angels but speak without love I am simply a gong booming or a cymbal clashing If I have the gift of prophecy understanding all the mysteries there are and knowing everything and if I have faith in all its fullness to move mountains but without love then I am nothing at all First Corinthians chapter thirteen As women you find your place in the world out of love not animosity Love is not limited to the Christian love is not just for the church If you wish to conquer us show us love and not scorn Faith moves mountains love moves human hearts The people opposing you are people not things Your enemy is not men but ignorant men don't confuse the men with their ignorance It has taken years it will take years more don't be impatient and don't hate What time is it He looked around suddenly concerned Here He passed a card to Kirsten You call me I have to be going It was nice meeting you He left us then I realized after he had gone very suddenly realized that he had forgotten to pay the check THE BISHOP OF CALIFORNIA spoke to the members of FEM and then talked their governing board out of two thousand dollars as a contribution to the church s fund for world famine really a nominal sum and for a meritorious cause It took a while for the news that Tim was seeing Kirsten socially to percolate down to Jeff and me Jeff was simply amazed I thought it was funny It did not even strike Jeff as funny that his father had shaken two thousand dollars loose from FEM He had seen a free speech looming up that hadn t come to pass He had anticipated friction and dislike between his father and my friend Kirsten That had not come to pass either Jeff did not understand his own father The way I found out was through Kirsten not Tim I got a phone call the week following Tim s speech Kirsten wanted to go shopping with me in San Francisco When you're dating a bishop you do not tell everybody in town Kirsten spent hours fussing with dresses and blouses and tops and skirts at store after store before even hinting at what was going on My promised silence was secured in advance by means of oaths more elaborate than those of the Rosicrucians Telling me was ten percent of the fun she strung the revelation out seemingly forever We were in fact all the way down at the Marina before I fathomed what she had been hinting at If Jonathan Graves finds out Kirsten said Tim will have to resign I could not even remember who Jonathan Graves was The disclosure seemed irreal I thought at first that she was joking and then I thought she was hallucinating The Chronicle would put it on page one Kirsten said in a solemn tone And on top of the heresy trial Jesus Christ I said You can t sleep with a bishop I already have Kirsten said Who else have you told Nobody else I'm not sure if you should tell Jeff Tim and I talked it over We couldn t decide We I thought You destructive bitch I thought To get laid you d ruin a man s entire life a man who knew Dr King and Bobby Kennedy and determines the opinion of my opinion to name one person don't look so upset Kirsten said Whose idea was it Why should it make you angry Was it your idea Kirsten said calmly We discussed it After a minute I began to laugh Kirsten annoyed at first presently joined me we stood on the grass by the edge of the bay laughing and holding onto each other Passing people regarded us with curiosity Was it any good I managed to say finally I mean what was it like It was terrific But now he has to confess Does that mean you can t do it again It just means he has to confess again aren't you going to go to hell Kirsten said He is I'm not Doesn t that bother you That I'm not going to hell She giggled We have to be real adult about this I said Yes we do We absolutely have to be totally adult We have to walk around as if everything is normal This is not normal I mean it isn t like I'm saying it s abnormal in the sense of you know Like making it with a goat Kirsten said I wonder if there s a word for it making it with an Episcopal bishop Bishopric Tim told me that word Bishop prick No bishop ric you're not pronouncing it right We had to hold onto each other to keep from falling neither of us could stop laughing It s the place he lives or something Oh God She wiped the tears of laughter from her eyes Always be sure you pronounce it bishop ric This is terrible We really are going to go to hell straight to hell You know what he let me do Kirsten leaned close to me to whisper in my ear I tried on some of his robes and his miter you know the shovel hat The first lady bishop You may not be the first I looked great I looked better than he does I want you to see We re getting an apartment For Christ s sake don't say anything about this part especially but he s paying for it out of his Discretionary Fund Church money I stared at her Listen Kirsten looked solemn again but she could not maintain her expression she hid her face in her hands Isn t that illegal I said No it s not illegal That s why it s called the Bishop s Discretionary Fund he gets to do with it what he wants I'm going to go to work for him as we haven t decided but some kind of general secretary like a booking agent or something to handle all the speeches and traveling he does His business affairs I can still stay on with the organization FEM I mean She was silent a moment and then she said The problem is going to be Bill I can t tell him because he s nuts again I shouldn t say that Deep autistic fugal withdrawal with impaired ideation compounded with delusions of reference plus alternating catatonic stupor and excitement He s down at Hoover Pavilion at Stanford Mostly for diagnosis In terms of diagnosis they re the best on the West Coast They use something like four psychiatrists for diagnosis three from the hospital itself and one from outside I'm sorry I said The Army thing did it Anxiety about being drafted They accused him of malingering Well I guess it s part of life He had to drop out of school anyhow He would have had to drop school anyhow is what I'm trying to say His episodes always begin the same way he starts crying and he doesn t take out the trash The crying part doesn t bother me it s the goddamn trash It just piles up trash and garbage And he doesn t bathe And he stays in his apartment And he doesn t pay his utility bills so they cut off his gas and electricity And he starts writing letters to the White House This is one area Tim and I haven t discussed I really don't discuss it with very many people So I would estimate that I can keep our affair my affair with Tim secret because I ve had practice keeping things secret No pardon me it doesn t begin with him crying it begins with him not being able to drive his car Driving phobia he s afraid he ll veer off the road First it has to do with the Eastshore Freeway and then it spreads to all the other streets and then he winds up afraid to walk to the store so as a result he can t shop for food But that doesn t matter because by that time he isn t eating anything anyhow She lapsed into silence There s a Bach cantata about it she said finally and I saw her try to smile A line in the Coffee Cantata About having trouble with your children They re a hundred thousand miseries something like that Bill used to play the goddamn thing Few people know Bach wrote a cantata about coffee but he did We walked in silence It sounds as if I said It s schizophrenia They use him to try out every new phenothiazine that comes along He goes in cycles but the cycles get worse He s sick longer and he s more sick I shouldn t have brought it up it s not your problem I don't mind Kirsten said Maybe Tim can effect a deep spiritual cure Didn t Jesus cure mentally ill people He sent the evil spirits into a bunch of pigs I said And they all rushed over a cliff That seems like a waste Kirsten said They may have eaten them anyhow Not if they were Jews Anyhow who would want to eat a pork chop that had an evil spirit in it I shouldn t joke about this but I will talk to Tim about it But not for a while I think Bill got it from me I'm screwed up God knows I'm screwed up and I screwed him up I keep looking at Jeff and noticing the difference between them they re about the same age and Jeff has such a good grip on reality don't bet on it I said Kirsten said When Bill gets out of the hospital I d like him to meet Tim I d like him to meet your husband in fact they never have met have they No I said But if you think Jeff can serve as a role model I'm really not Bill has very few friends He s not outgoing I ve talked about you and your husband you're both his age Thinking about it I perceived down the pipe of time Kirsten s lunatic son messing up our lives That thought surprised me It was utterly devoid of charity and it had in it an essence of fear I knew my husband and I knew myself Neither of us was ready to take on the job of amateur therapy Kirsten however was an organizer She organized people into doing things good things but things not necessarily to their own benefit I had at that instant a keen intuition that I was being hustled At the Bad Luck I had essentially witnessed Bishop Archer and Kirsten Lundborg hustle each other in an intricate transaction but it was apparently a transaction that benefited them both or anyhow they both thought so This with her son Bill looked to me like a purely one way matter I didn t see what we had to gain Let me know when he s out I said But I think that Tim because of his professional training would be a better But there s the age difference And you get the element of the father figure Maybe that would be good Maybe that s what your son needs Glaring at me Kirsten said I ve done an excellent job of raising Bill His father walked out of our lives and never looked back I didn t mean I know what you meant Kirsten stared at me and now really she had changed she was angry and I could see hatred on her face It made her look older It made her look in fact physically ill She had a bloated quality and I felt uncomfortable I thought then of the pigs that Jesus had cast the evil spirits into the pigs that rushed over the cliff This is what you do when an evil spirit inhabits you I thought This is the sign this look the stigma Maybe your son did inherit it from you But now we had an altered situation Now she was my father in law s pro tern lover potentially his mistress I couldn t tell Kirsten to go fuck herself She was family in an illegal and unethical way I was stuck with her All of the curses of family I thought and none of the blessings And I arranged it The idea of introducing her and Tim had been mine Bad karma I thought come back from the other side of the barn As my father used to say Standing there in the grass near the San Francisco Bay in the midafternoon sunlight I felt uncomfortable This is really in some respects a reckless and savage person I said to myself She dabbles in the life of a famous and respected man she has a psychotic son pins bristle from her as from an animal Bishop Archer s future depends on Kirsten not flying into a rage one day and phoning up the Chronicle his future depends on her unending goodwill Let s go back to Berkeley I said No Kirsten shook her head I have yet to find a dress I can wear I came to the City to shop Clothes are very important to me They have to be I'm seen in public a lot and I expect to be seen much more now that I'm with Tim Rage still showed on her face I said I ll go back by BART I walked away She s a very attractive woman Jeff said that night when I told him Considering her age Kirsten is on reds I said You don't know that I suspect it Her mood changes I ve seen her take them Yellow jackets You know Barbiturates Sleeping pills Everybody takes something You smoke grass I said But I'm sane You may not be when you get to be her age It s too bad about her son It s too bad about your father Tim can manage her He may have to have her killed Eying me Jeff said What a strange thing to say She s out of control And what happens when Bounding Bill the Dingaling finds out I thought you said He ll be out It costs thousands of dollars to be in Hoover Pavilion You stay about four days I ve known people who passed in their front door and out the back Even with all the financial resources of the Episcopal Diocese of California Kirsten can t keep him in there He ll bound out on kangaroo spring shoes one of these days his eyes rolling around in their sockets that s all Tim needs First she has me introduce her to Tim then she tells me about her son the madman Tim ll be preaching a sermon some Sunday morning at Grace Cathedral and all of a sudden this lunatic will stand up and God will grant him the gift of tongues and that ll be the end of the most famous bishop in America Life is a risk I said That s probably what Dr King said that last morning of his life They re all dead but Tim anyhow Dr King is dead Bobby Kennedy and Jack Kennedy are dead I ve set up your father I knew it that evening as I sat with my husband in our little living room He stops bathing he stops taking out the garbage he writes letters what more do you need to know He s probably writing a letter to the pope right now Martians probably walked through the wall of his room and told him about his mother and your father Christ And I did it I reached around under the couch for my beer can of grass don't get loaded Please You worry about me I thought when madness rules our friends One joint I said Half a joint I ll toke up A puff I ll look at the joint I ll pretend to look at the joint I fished the empty beer can out I guess I moved my stash I said to myself To a safer place I remember in the middle of the night I decided that monsters were going to rip me off Mad Margaret from Ruddigore enters the picture of theatrical madness or however Gilbert put it Maybe I smoked it all up I said And I don't remember I thought because that s what mary jane does to you fucks up your short term memory Probably I smoked it up five minutes ago and already I ve forgotten you're borrowing trouble Jeff said I like Kirsten I think it ll work out Tim misses my mother Tim misses getting his rocks off I said to myself That is a truly kinky lady I said I had to come home by snail train It took two hours I'm going to talk to your father No you're not I will I'm responsible My stash is behind the stereo tuner I'm going to get totally wasted and phone Tim and tell him that I hesitated and then futility crushed me I felt like crying Seating myself I got out a Kleenex Goddamn it I said Fry the bacon is not a game bishops are supposed to play If I had known he felt that way Fry the bacon Jeff said wonderingly Pathology frightens me I sense pathology I sense highly professional responsible people wrecking their lives in exchange for a warm body a temporarily warm body I don't even sense the bodies staying warm for that matter I sense everything getting cold you're only supposed to get into such limited time binding if you're on junk and think in hours these people are supposed to think in terms of decades Lifetimes They meet in a restaurant run by Fred the Hatchetman which is ill omen incarnate the ghost of Berkeley coming back to get us all and when they leave they have each other s phone number and it s all accomplished What I wanted to do was help a women s lib group but then everyone queeged out on me you included You were there you watched it happen I watched it happen I was as crazy as the rest of you I suggested that Fred the Soviet narc get photographed with the Bishop of the Diocese of California they should have been in drag according to my logic The trouble with seeing ruin coming is that I wiped at my eyes Please God let me locate my mary jane Jeff look behind the tuner It s in a Carl s junior bag a white bag Okay Okay Obligingly Jeff rummaged behind the tuner I found it Calm down You can see ruin but you can t see what direction it s coming from It just sort of hangs there like a cloud Who was that character in Li l Abner who had the cloud following him around You know this was the stuff the FBI was trying to hang on Martin Luther King Nixon loves this shit Maybe Kirsten is a government agent Maybe I am Maybe we re programmed Pardon me for playing Cassandra in our collective movie but I see death I thought Tim Archer your father was a spiritual person Does he dive into I broke off My metaphor is offensive Forget it Does he go after women like this normally I mean is this just merely the fact that I know about it and arranged it Remind me not to go to Mass not that I ever do There s no telling where the hands that hold out the chalice That s enough No I get to be crazy along with Bong Bong Bill and Creepy Kirsten and Tim the No Longer Torpid And Jeff the Jerk you jerk Is there a joint already rolled or do I have to chew up grass like a cow I can t roll a joint right now look I held out my hands they shook This is called a grand mat seizure Get somebody in here Get up to the Avenue and score me some tranks I will tell you what is coming somebody s life is going to get destroyed because of all this not this that I'm doing right now but this that I did at the Bad Luck appropriately named When I die I will have a choice head up in shit or head down in shit Shit is the word for it what I did I had begun to gasp Crying and gasping I reached for the joint my husband held Light it for me I said you fool I really can t chew it up it s a waste You have to chew up half a lid to get off or at least I do God knows about the rest of the world maybe they can get off anyhow any time Head down in shit and never able to get loaded again exactly what I deserve And if I could call it all back if I knew any way to call it back I would I am cursed with total insight I see and You want to go to Kaiser The hospital I stared at him I mean you're out of control That s what total insight does for you Thanks I took the joint which he had lit and inhaled At least now I could no longer talk And pretty soon I would no longer know or think Or even remember Put on Sticky Fingers I said to myself The Stones Sister Morphine Hearing about all those bloody sheets calms me I wish there was a comforting hand placed on my head I thought I'm not the one who s going to be dead tomorrow although I should be Let us by all means name the most innocent person possible That will be the one The bitch made me walk home From San Francisco You took That s walking Jeff said I like her I think she s a good friend I think she will be and probably is already good for Dad Has it occurred to you that you're jealous What I said That s right I said jealous you're jealous of the relationship You wish you were part of it I see your reaction as an insult to me I should be our relationship should be enough for you I'm going for a walk Suit yourself If you had eyes in the front of your head let me finish I ll be calm I ll say it calmly Tim is not just a religious figure he speaks for thousands in the church and outside the church maybe more so outside Do you grasp it If he tumbles we all take a fall We all are doomed He is almost the last one left the others are dead The thing about this is it isn t necessary It s like he decided He saw it and he walked right at it he didn t duck and he didn t fight he embraced it You think this what I feel is because I had to come home on the train One by one they got every public figure and now Tim hands over the keys hands them over under his own power without a fight And you want to fight Me if necessary I said I see you as stupid I see everyone as dumb I see stupidity winning This is not something the Pentagon is doing This is dumb This is walking right at it and saying Take me I'm Jealousy Jeff said Your psychological motivation is all over this house I have no psychological motivation I just want to see someone there when the firing ends someone who isn t I broke off don't come around later and say this was done to us because it wasn t And don't tell me it was a complete surprise A bishop who has an affair with a woman he meets in a restaurant this is a man who just finished backing over a gasoline pump and drove happily away And the pump came after him That s how it works you flatten some joker s pump and he runs until he catches up with you you're in a car and he s on foot but he seeks you out and then all of a sudden there he is This is that this is someone chasing us down and he will catch up he always does I saw that pump jockey he was mad He was going to keep running They never give up And you see that now Due to one of your best friends That s the worst kind Grinning Jeff said I know that story It s a W C Fields story There s this director And she isn t running any more I said She caught up with him They re renting an apartment All it takes is one nosy neighbor What about this redneck bishop prosecuting Tim for heresy What would he do with this If someone is after you for heresy do you bang the next broad you meet for lunch And then go shopping for an apartment Look I walked over to my husband Where do you go after being a bishop Is Tim tired of that already He got tired of everything else he ever did He even got tired of being an alcoholic he s the only hopeless drunk who sobered himself up out of boredom out of a short attention span People generally will their own misfortune I see us doing that now I see him getting bored and subconsciously saying What the hell it s dull putting on these funny clothes every day let s stir up some human misery and see what comes out of it Laughing Jeff said You know what who you remind me of The witch in Purcell s Dido and Aeneas What do you mean Who like dismal ravens crying Beat the windows of the dying I'm sorry but You fool Berkeley intellectual I said What horse s ass world do you inhabit Not the same as me I hope Quoting some old verse that s what did us in They will report when they dig up our bones your dad quoted the Bible in the restaurant the same way you're doing now You ought to hit me or me you I ll be glad when civilization ends People babble out bits of books Put on Sticky Fingers put on Sister Morphine I can t be trusted with the stereo at this moment You do it for me Thanks for the joint When you ve calmed down When you ve woken up I said it ll all be over Jeff bent to search for the record I wanted to hear He said nothing Finally he had become angry A dollar short and a day late I thought and at the wrong person Like with me Destroyed by our giant intellects reasoning and pondering and doing nothing Nitwits rule We squabble The sorceress in Dido you are right Thy hand Belinda darkness shades me on thy bosom let me rest more I would but Death invades me And what else does she say Death is now a welcome guest Shit I thought It is relevant He s right Absolutely right Fiddling with the stereo Jeff put the Stones record on The music calmed me A little But I still cried thinking about Tim And all because they are stupid It goes no deeper than that And that is the worst of it all that it is that simple That there is no more A few days later after thinking about it and making up my mind I phoned Grace Cathedral and got an appointment to see Tim He met me in his office which was large and beautiful in a building separate from the cathedral itself After greeting me with a hug and kiss he showed me two ancient clay vessels which he explained had been used as oil lamps in the Near East over four thousand years ago As I watched him handling them the thought came to me that the lamps probably in fact certainly did not belong to him they belonged to the Diocese I wondered what they were worth It was amazing that they had survived all these years It s nice of you to give me some of your time I said I know how busy you are The expression on Tim s face told me that he knew why I had shown up in his office He nodded absently as if in fact giving me as little of his attention as he could manage I had seen him tune out that way several times a part of his brain listened but the greater part had sealed itself off already When I had finished delivering my set little speech Tim said gravely Paul you know had been a Pharisee For them a strict observance of the minutiae of the Torah the Law was everything That particularly involved ritual purity But later after his conversion he saw salvation not in the Law but in zadiqah which is the state of righteousness that Jesus Christ brings I want you to sit down with me here He beckoned me over opening a very large leatherbound Bible you're familiar with Romans four through eight No I'm not I said But I sat down beside him I could see it coming the lecture The sermon Tim had met me prepared Romans five states Paul s basic premise that we are saved through grace and not by works He read then from the Bible he held open on his lap So far then we have seen that through our Lord Jesus Christ by faith we are judged righteous and at peace with God He glanced up at me his gaze was keen and sharp This was Timothy Archer the lawyer since it is by faith and through Jesus that we have entered this state of grace in which we can boast about looking forward to God s glory Lets s see He ran his fingers down the page his lips moving If it is certain that through one man s fall so many died it is even more certain that divine grace coming through the one man Jesus Christ came to so many as an abundant free gift He looked further on turning pages Yes ah Here But now we are rid of the Law freed by death from our imprisonment free to serve in the new spiritual way and not the old way of a written law Again he looked further along The reason therefore why those who are in Christ Jesus are not condemned is that the law of the spirit of life in Christ Jesus has set you free from the law of sin and death He glanced up at me This goes to the heart of Paul s perception What sin really refers to is hostility toward God Literally it means missing the mark as if for example you shot an arrow and it fell short too low or went too high What mankind needs what it requires is righteousness Only God has that and only God can provide it to men men and women I don't mean I understand I said Paul s perception is that faith pistis has the power the absolute power to kill sin Out of this comes freedom from the Law one is not required to believe that by following a formal stipulated code code ethics it s called one is saved That position that one is saved by following a very intricate complex system of code ethics is what Paul rebelled against that was the position of the Pharisees and that s what he turned from This really is what Christianity faith in our Lord Jesus Christ is all about righteousness through grace and grace coming through faith I'm going to have you read Yes I said but the Bible says you're not supposed to commit adultery Instantly Tim said Adultery is sexual unfaithfulness on the part of a married person I am no longer married Kirsten is no longer married Oh I said nodding The Seventh Commandment Which pertains to the sanctity of marriage Tim set down his Bible and crossed the room to the vast bookshelves he lifted down a blue backed volume As he returned he opened the book and searched its pages Let me quote to you what Dr Hertz said the late Chief Rabbi of the British Empire In connection with the Seventh Commandment Exodus twenty thirteen Adultery Is an execrable and god detested wrong doing Philo This Commandment against infidelity warns husband and wife alike against profaning the sacred Covenant of Marriage He read further silently then shut the book I think you have enough common sense Angel to understand that Kirsten and I are But it s risky I said Driving on the Golden Gate Bridge is risky Do you know that Yellow Cabs are not allowed I mean not allowed by Yellow Cab not the police to drive in the fast lane on the Golden Gate Bridge What they call suicide lane If a driver is caught driving in that lane he is fired But people drive in the fast lane on the Golden Gate Bridge constantly Maybe that s a poor analogy No it s a good one I said Do you drive in the fast lane on the Golden Gate Bridge After a pause I said Sometimes What if I came to you and sat you down and started lecturing you about it Wouldn t you think I was treating you as a child not an adult Do you follow what I'm saying When an adult does something you don't approve of you discuss the matter with him or her I'm willing to discuss my relationship with Kirsten with you because for one thing you're my daughter in law but much more important you're someone I know and care about and love I think that s the salient term here it s the key to Paul s thinking Agape in the Greek Translated into Latin it s caritas from which we get the word caring to be concerned about someone As you're concerned about me now myself and your friend Kirsten You care about us That s right I said That s why I'm here Then for you caring is important Yes I said Obviously You can call it agape or you can call it caritas or love or caring about another person but whatever you call it let me read from Paul Bishop Archer again opened his big Bible he flipped through the pages rapidly knowing exactly where he was going First Corinthians chapter thirteen If I have the gift of prophecy understanding Yes you quoted that at the Bad Luck I interrupted And I will quote it again His voice was brisk If I give away all that I possess piece by piece and if I even let them take my body to burn it but am without love it will do me no good whatever Now listen to this Love does not come to an end But if there are gifts of prophecy the time will come when they must fail or the gift of languages it will not continue for ever and knowledge for this too the time will come when it must fail For our knowledge is imperfect and our prophesying is imperfect but once perfection comes all imperfect things will disappear When I was a child I used to talk like a child and think like a child and argue like a child but now I am a man all childish ways are put behind me The phone on his big desk rang then Looking annoyed Bishop Archer set down his Bible open Excuse me He went to get the phone As I sat waiting for him to finish his phone conversation I looked over the passage he had been reading It was a passage familiar to me but in the King James translation This Bible I saw was the Jerusalem Bible I had never seen it before I read on past the point at which he had stopped His phone conversation finished Bishop Archer returned I have to be off There s an African bishop waiting to see me they just brought him here from the airport It says I said putting my finger on the passage in his big Bible that all we see is a dim reflection It also says In short there are three things that last faith hope and love and the greatest of these is love I would point out to you that that sums up the kerygma of our Lord What if Kirsten tells people I think she can be counted on to be discreet He had already reached the door of his office reflexively I rose to my feet and followed after him She told me you're my son s wife Yeah well I'm sorry I have to run off like this Bishop Archer shut and locked his office door behind us God bless He kissed me on the forehead We want to have you over when we re set up Kirsten found an apartment today in the Tenderloin I haven t seen it I'm leaving that up to her And off he strode leaving me standing there He got me on a technicality I realized I had adultery confused with fornication I keep forgetting he was a lawyer I entered his large office with something to say and never said it I went in smart and came out stupid With nothing in between Maybe if I didn t smoke dope I could argue better He won I lost No he lost I lost we both lost Shit I never said love was bad I never knocked agape That was not the point the fucking point Not getting caught is the point Bolting your feet down to the floor is the point the floor we call reality As I started toward the street I thought I am passing judgment on one of the most successful men in the world I will never be known as he is known I will never influence opinion I did not put away my pectoral cross for the duration of the Vietnam War as Tim did Who the fuck am I NOT LONG THEREAFTER Jeff and I received an invitation to visit the Bishop of California and his mistress at their hideout in the Tenderloin It turned out to be a sort of party Kirsten had fixed canapes and hors d oeuvres we could smell food cooking in the kitchen Tim had me drive him to a nearby liquor store to get wine they had forgotten I chose the wine Tim stood blankly as if abstracted while I paid the clerk I guess when you ve been a member of AA you learn to phase out in a liquor store Back at the apartment in the medicine cabinet of the bathroom I found a vast bottle of Dexamyl the size bottle they give you when you're going on a long trip Kirsten doing speed I asked myself Making no noise I took down the bottle The bishop s name was on the prescription label Well I thought Off booze and onto speed aren't they supposed to warn you about that in AA I flushed the toilet so as to create some sound and while the water gurgled I opened the bottle and stuck a few of the Dex tablets in my pocket This is something you automatically do if you live in Berkeley no one thinks anything about it On the other hand no one in Berkeley leaves their dope in the bathroom Presently the four of us sat around the modest living room relaxing Everyone but Tim held a drink Tim wore a red shirt and permapress slacks He did not look like a bishop He looked like Kirsten Lundborg s lover This is a really nice place I said On the way home from the liquor store Tim had talked about private detectives and how they go about finding you They sneak into your apartment while you're gone and go through all the dresser drawers The way you catch on to this is by taping a human hair to every outer door I think Tim had seen that in a movie If you come back and find the hair gone or broken he informed me as we walked from the car to the apartment you know you're being watched He narrated then the history of the FBI in regard to Dr King It was a story everyone in Berkeley knew I listened politely In the living room of their hideout that evening I first heard about the Zadokite Documents Now of course you can buy the Doubleday Anchor book the Patton Myers and Abre translation which is complete With the Helen James introduction dealing with mysticism comparing and contrasting the Zadokites with for example the Qumran people who presumably were Essenes although that has really never been established I feel Tim said that this may prove more important than even the Nag Hammadi Library We already have a fair working knowledge of Gnosticism but we know nothing about the Zadokites except for the fact that they were Jews What is the approximate date on the Zadokite scrolls Jeff asked They have made a preliminary estimate of about two hundred B C E Tim said Then they could have influenced Jesus Jeff said It s not likely Tim said I ll be flying over there to London in March I ll have a chance to talk to the translators I wish John Allegro were involved but he s not He talked for a while about Allegro s work in connection with the Qumran scrolls the so called Dead Sea Scrolls Wouldn t it be interesting Kirsten said if the She hesitated Zadokite Documents turned out to contain Christian material Christianity is after all based on Judaism Tim said I mean specific sayings attributed to Jesus Kirsten said There is not that clear a break in the rabbinical tradition Tim said You find Hillel expressing some of the ideas we consider basic to the New Testament And of course Matthew understood everything that Jesus did and said as a fulfillment of Old Testament prophecies Matthew wrote to Jews and for Jews and essentially as a Jew God s plan set forth in the Old Testament is brought to completion by Jesus The term Christianity was not in use at his time by and large apostolic Christians simply spoke of the Way Thus they stressed its naturalness and universality After a pause he added And you find the expression the word of the Lord That appears in Acts six The word of the Lord continued to spread the number of disciples in Jerusalem was greatly increased What does Zadokite derive from Kirsten asked Zadok a priest of Israel about the time of David Tim said He founded a priestly house the Zadokites They were of the house of Eleazar There is mention of Zadok in the Qumran scrolls Let me check He rose to go get a book from a still unpacked carton First Chronicles chapter twenty four These also side by side with their kinsmen the sons of Aaron cast lots in the presence of Kind David Zadok There he is mentioned Tim shut the book It was another Bible But I guess now we re going to find out a lot more Jeff said Yes I hope so Tim said When I'm in London He now as was his custom abruptly shifted mental gears I'm commissioning a rock mass to be given at Grace this Christmas Scrutinizing me he said What is your opinion about Frank Zappa I was at a loss for an answer We would arrange for the actual service to be recorded Tim continued So it could be released as an album Captain Beefheart has also been recommended to me And there were several other names offered Where could I get a Frank Zappa album to listen to At a record store Jeff said Is Frank Zappa black Tim asked I don't see that that matters Kirsten said To me that is inverse prejudice Tim said I was just curious This is an area I know nothing about Does any of you have an opinion about Marc Bolan He s dead I said you're talking about T Rex Marc Bolan is dead Jeff said He looked amazed I could be wrong I said I suggest Ray Davies He writes the Kinks stuff He s very good Would you look into it for me Tim said speaking both to Jeff and me I wouldn t know how to go about doing that I said Kirsten said quietly I ll take care of it You could get Paul Kantner and Gracie Slick I said They just live over at Bolinas in Marin County I know Kirsten said nodding placidly and with the air of total confidence Bullshit I thought You don't even know who I'm talking about Already you're in charge just from being set up in this apartment It isn t even that much of an apartment Tim said I would like Janis Joplin to sing at Grace She died in I said Then whom do you recommend in her place Tim asked He waited expectantly In Janis Joplin s place I said In Janis Joplin s place I ll have to think that over I really can t come up with a name off the top of my head That will take some time Kirsten regarded me with a mixture of expressions Mostly disapproval I think what she s trying to say Kirsten said is that no one can or ever will take Joplin s place Where would I get one of her records Tim said At a record store Jeff said Would you do that for me his father said Jeff and I have all her records I said There aren't that many We ll bring them over Ralph McTell Kirsten said I want all these suggestions written down Tim said A rock mass at Grace Cathedral is going to attract a good deal of attention I thought There is no such person as Ralph McTell From across the room Kirsten smiled at me a complicated smile She had me I couldn t be sure one way or another He s on the Paramount label Kirsten said Her smile increased I had really hoped to get Janis Joplin Tim said half to himself He seemed puzzled They were playing a song with her perhaps she didn t write it on the car radio this morning She s black isn t she She is white Jeff said and she is dead I hope somebody is writing this down Tim said My husband s emotional involvement with Kirsten Lundborg did not begin at one particular moment on a certain day at least so far as I could discern Initially he maintained that Kirsten was good for the bishop she had enough practical realism to keep both of them anchored not floating endlessly upward It is necessary in evaluating these things to distinguish your awareness from that of which you are aware I can say when I noticed it but that is all I can say Considering her age Kirsten still managed to emit tolerable amounts of sexually stimulating waves That was how Jeff saw her From my standpoint she remained an older female friend who now by virtue of her relationship with Bishop Archer outranked me The degree of erotic provocativeness in a woman has no interest for me I do not swing both ways as the expression goes Nor for me is it a threat Until of course my own husband is involved But the problem is with him then While I worked at the law office and candle shop seeing to it that drug dealers got out of trouble as fast as they got in Jeff bothered his head with a series of extension courses at the University of California We in Northern California had not quite reached the point of offering survey courses in how to compose your own mantras that belonged to the Southland totally despised by everyone in the Bay Area Jeff had enrolled in a serious project tracing the ills of modern Europe back to the Thirty Years War which had devastated Germany circa caused the collapse of the Holy Roman Empire and culminated in the rise of Nazism and Hitler s Third Reich Above and beyond the courses pertaining to this Jeff now advanced his own theory as to the root of it all Upon reading Schiller s Wallenstein Trilogy Jeff leaped to the intuitive in sight that had the great general not gotten involved with as trology the imperial cause would have triumphed and as a result World War Two would never have come into being The third play in Schiller s trilogy The Death of Wallenstein profoundly affected my husband He regarded the play as equal to any of Shakespeare s and a whole lot better than most Moreover no one had read it at least insofar as he could tell except himself To him Wallenstein loomed as one of the ultimate enigmas of Western history Jeff noted that Hitler like Wallenstein relied in times of crisis on the occult rather than on reason In Jeff s view this all added up to something significant but he could not fathom just what Hitler and Wallenstein had had so many traits in common Jeff maintained that the resemblance bordered on the uncanny Both were great but eccentric generals and both had utterly wrecked Germany Jeff hoped to do a paper on the coincidences extracting from the evidence the conclusion that the abandoning of Christianity for the occult opened the door to universal ruin Jesus and Simon Magus as Jeff saw it stood as the bipolarities absolute and distinct I couldn t have cared less You see this is what going to school forever and ever does to you While I slaved away at the law office and candle shop Jeff read everything in the U C Berkeley Library on for instance the Battle of Lutzen November at which time and place Wallenstein s fortunes were decided Gustavus II Adolphus king of Sweden died at Lutzen but the Swedes won anyhow The real significance of this victory lay of course in the fact that at no time again would the Catholic powers be in a position to crush the Protestant cause Jeff however viewed it all in terms of Wallenstein He reread and reread Schiller s trilogy and tried to reconstruct from it and from more accurate historical accounts the precise moment when Wallenstein lost touch with reality It s like with Hitler Jeff said to me Can you say he was always crazy Can you say he was crazy at all And if he was crazy but not always crazy when did he become crazy and what caused him to become crazy Why should a successful man who holds really an enormous amount of power a staggering amount of power power to determine human history why should he drift off like that Okay with Hitler it was probably paranoid schizophrenia and those injections that quack doctor was giving him But neither factor was involved in Wallenstein s case Kirsten being Norwegian took a sympathetic interest in Jeff s preoccupation with Gustavus Adolphus campaign into Central Europe In between telling Swede jokes she revealed great pride in the role that the great Protestant King had played in the Thirty Years War Also she knew something about all this which I did not Both she and Jeff agreed that the Thirty Years War had been up until World War One the most dreadful war since the Huns sacked Rome Germany had been reduced to cannibalism Soldiers on both sides had regularly skewered bodies and roasted them Jeff s reference books hinted at even more abominations too dreadful to detail Everything connected with that period in time and place had been dreadful We are still paying the price today Jeff said for that war Yeah I guess it really was dreadful I said seated by myself in a corner of our living room reading a current issue of Howard the Duck Jeff said I don't think you're particularly interested Glancing up I said I get tired from bailing out heroin dealers I'm always the one they send over to the bail bondsman I'm sorry if I don't take the Thirty Years War as seriously as you and Kirsten do Everything hinges on the Thirty Years War And the Thirty Years War hinged on Wallenstein What are you going to do when they go to England Your father and Kirsten He stared at me She s going too She told me They ve got that agency set up Focus Center where she s his agent or whatever Jesus Christ Jeff said bitterly I went back to reading Howard the Duck It was the episode where space people turn Howard the Duck into Richard Nixon Reciprocally Richard Nixon grows feathers while addressing the nation on network TV Likewise the top brass at the Pentagon And they re going to be gone how long Jeff said Until Tim figures out the meaning of the Zadokite Documents and how they pertain to Christianity Shit Jeff said What s Q I said Q Jeff echoed Tim said that preliminary reports based on fragmentary translations of some documents Q is the hypothetical source for the Synoptics His voice was brutal and rough What are the Synoptics The first three Gospels Matthew Mark and Luke They supposedly come from one source probably Aramaic Nobody s ever been able to prove it Well I said Tim told me on the phone the other night while you were in class that the translators in London think that the Zadokite Documents contain not just Q but the material Q is based on They re not sure Tim sounded more excited than I ever heard him sound before But the Zadokite Documents date from two hundred years before Christ That s probably why he was so excited Jeff said I want to go along You can t I said Why not Raising his voice he said Why don't I get to go if she gets to go I'm his son He s straining the Bishop s Discretionary Fund as it is They re going to be staying several months it s going to cost a whole lot Jeff walked out of the living room I continued reading After a time I realized I was hearing a strange sound I lowered my copy of Howard the Duck and listened In the kitchen in the darkness by himself my husband was crying One of the strangest and most perplexing accounts I ever read concerning my husband s suicide was that he Jeff Archer Bishop Timothy Archer s son killed himself because he was afraid he was a homosexual Some book written a number of years after his death after all three of them had died mangled the facts so thoroughly that when you had finished reading it I don't even remember the title or who wrote it you knew less about Jeff and Bishop Archer and Kirsten Lundborg than before you started It is like information theory it is noise driving out signal But it is noise posing as signal so you do not even recognize it as noise The intelligence agencies call it disinformation something the Soviet Bloc relies on heavily If you can float enough disinformation into circulation you will totally abolish everyone s contact with reality probably your own included Jeff held two mutually exclusive views toward his father s mistress On the one hand she sexually stimulated him so he felt strongly but wickedly attracted to her On the other hand he loathed her and hated her and resented her for he supposed replacing him in terms of Tim s interest and affections But it did not end even there although I didn t discern the rest until years had passed Beyond and above being jealous of Kirsten he was jealous of well Jeff had it all screwed up I can t really untangle it One has to bear in mind the special problems in being the son of a man whose picture has appeared on the cover of Time and Newsweek and who gets interviewed by David Frost shows up on the Johnny Carson program gets political cartoons in major newspapers devoted to him what in Christ s name do you do as the son For one week Jeff joined them in England and regarding that week I know little Jeff came back mute and withdrawn and that was when he headed for the hotel room in which he shot himself in the face one late night I am not going to go into my feelings about that as a way of killing yourself It did bring the bishop back from London within a matter of hours which in a certain sense the suicide was all about In a very real sense it also had to do with Q or rather the source of Q now referred to in the newspaper articles as U Q which is Ur Quelle in German Original Source Behind Q lay the Ur Quelle and this is what led Timothy Archer to London and several months in a hotel with his mistress ostensibly his business agent and general secretary No one had ever expected the documents behind Q to reappear in the world no one had known that U Q existed Since I am not a Christian and never will be after the deaths of the people I loved I am not now and was not then particularly interested but I suppose it is theologically important especially so inasmuch as the date assigned to U Q is two hundred years before the time of Jesus WHAT I REMEMBER most in the first newspaper articles to come out the first intimation we had anybody beyond the translators had that this was an even more important find than the Qumran scrolls was the articles said a particular Hebrew noun They spell it two different ways sometimes it showed up as anochi and sometimes anochi The word shows up in Exodus chapter twenty verse two This is a terribly moving and important section of the Torah for here God Himself speaks and he says I am the Lord thy God who brought thee out of the land of Egypt out of the house of bondage The first Hebrew word is anochi or anochi and it means I as in I am the Lord thy God Jeff showed me what the official Jewish commentary is on this part of the Torah The God adored by Judaism is not an impersonal Force an It whether spoken of as Nature or World Reason The God of Israel is the Source not only of power and life but of consciousness personality moral purpose and ethical action Even for me a non Christian or I should say a non Jew I guess this shakes me I am touched and changed I am not the same What is expressed here Jeff explained to me is in this single word one letter of the English alphabet the unique self consciousness of God As man towers above all the other creatures by his will and selfconscious action so God rules over all as the one completely selfconscious Mind and Will In both the visible and the invisible realms He manifests Himself as the absolutely free personality moral and spiritual who allots to everything its existence form and purpose That was written by Samuel M Cohon quoting Kaufmann Kohler Another Jewish writer Hermann Cohen wrote God answered him thus I am that which I am So shalt thou say to the children of Israel I am has sent me to you There is probably no greater miracle in the history of the spirit than that revealed in this verse For here a primeval language which is as yet without any philosophy emerges and haltingly pronounces the most profound word of all philosophy The name of God is I am that which I am This signifies that God is Being that God is the I which denotes the Existing One And this is what turned up at the wadi in Israel dating from B C E the wadi not far from Qumran this word lay at the heart of the Zadokite Documents and every Hebrew scholar knows this word and every Christian and Jew should know it but there at that wadi the word anokhi was used in a different way a way no living person had ever seen it employed before And so Tim and Kirsten stayed in London twice as long as they had intended to stay because the very core of something had been located the core in fact of the Decalogue as if the Lord had left tracings in his own autograph which is to say his own hand While these discoveries took place in the translating stage Jeff wandered around the U C Berkeley campus learning about the Thirty Years War and Wallenstein who had cut himself off progressively from reality during the worst war perhaps of all wars except for the total wars of this century I am not going to say that I have ascertained which particular drive killed my husband which thrust from the mix got to him but one did or they all did in chorus he is dead and I wasn t even there at the time nor did I expect it My expectation came initially when I learned that Kirsten and Tim had gotten involved in an invisible affair I said what I had to say then I took my best shot I visited the bishop at Grace Cathedral and found myself outargued with little effort on his part little effort and professional skill It was an easy verbal victory for Tim Archer So much for that If you intend to kill yourself you don't require a reason in the usual sense of the term just as to the contrary when you intend to stay alive no verbal articulated formal reason is necessary one you can seize on if the issue comes up Jeff had been left out I could see that his interest in the Thirty Years War really had to do with Kirsten his mind or some portion of it had noted her Scandinavian origin and another part of his mind had perceived and recorded the fact that the Swedish army was the victor and heroic power of that war his emotional pursuits and his intellectual pursuits wove together which was for a time to his advantage and then when Kirsten flew to England he found himself wrecked by his own cleverness Now he had to confront the fact that he didn t really give a good goddamn about Tilly and Wallenstein and the Holy Roman Empire he was in love with a woman his mother s age who was sleeping with his father and doing that eight thousand miles away and above and beyond everything else the two of them to his exclusion participated in one of the most exhilarating archeological theology discoveries in history on a day to day basis as the translations became available as the documents got patched and pasted together and the words emerged one by one and again and again the Hebrew word anokhi manifested itself in unusual contexts baffling contexts new contexts The documents spoke as if anokhi were present at the wadi It or he was referred to as here not there now not then Anokhi was not something the Zadokites thought about or knew about it was something they possessed It is very hard to read your library books and listen to a Donovan record no matter how good when a discovery of that magnitude is going on in another part of the world and if your father and his mistress both of whom you love and at the same time furiously hate are involved in that unfolding discovery what drove me frantic was Jeff playing and replaying Paul McCartney s first solo album he liked Teddy Boy in particular When he left me to go live alone in the hotel room the room where he shot himself he took the album with him although he had it turned out nothing to play it on He wrote me a number of times telling me that he was still active in antiwar happenings Probably he was I think though by and large he just sat alone in the hotel room trying to figure out how he felt about his father and even more important how he felt about Kirsten So that would be since the McCartney album came out in But see that left me alone too in our house I got the house Jeff died I told you not to live alone but I am speaking really to myself You can do any goddamn thing you want but I am never going to live alone again I ll take in street people before I let that happen to me that isolation Just don't play any Beatles albums around me That s the main thing I ask I can take Joplin because I still think it s funny that Tim thought Joplin was alive and black instead of dead and white but I do not want to hear the Beatles because they are linked to too much pain in me inside me in my life in what happened I am not quite rational myself when it comes down to it to specifically my husband s suicide I hear in my mind a melange of John and Paul and George with Ringo thumping away in the rear somewhere with fragments of tunes and their words critical terms pertaining to souls suffering a great deal although not in a way I can pin down except of course for my husband s death and then Kirsten s death and finally Tim Archer s death but I suppose that is enough Now with John Lennon shot everyone is pierced as I have been so I can fucking well stop feeling sorry for myself and join the rest of the world no better off than they are no worse off either Often when I look back to Jeff s suicide I discover that I rearrange dates and events in sequences more syntonic to my mind that is I edit I condense cut bits out do a fast number myself so that for example I no longer recall viewing Jeff s body and identifying it I have managed to forget the name of the hotel where he stayed I don't know how long he stayed there As near as I can make out he didn t hang around the house very long after Tim and Kirsten flew to London one early letter came from them typed signed by both of them but almost certainly written by Kirsten Possibly Tim dictated it The first hint of the magnitude of the find showed up in that letter I didn t recognize what the news implied but Jeff did So perhaps he left right after that What surprised me the most was to grasp all at once that Jeff had wanted to go into the priesthood but what point was there in view of his father s role But this left a vacuum Jeff did not want to do anything else either He could not become a priest he did not care about any other profession So he remained what we in Berkeley called a professional student he never stopped going to Cal Maybe he left and came back Our marriage hadn t been working for some time I have blank spots back to perhaps a full year missing in all Jeff had emotional problems that I later repressed any knowledge of We both repressed it There is always free psychotherapy in the Bay Area and we took advantage of it I don't think Jeff could be called could have been called mentally ill he simply wasn t terribly happy Sometimes it is not a drive to die but a failure of a subtle kind a failing of the sense of joy He fell out of life by degrees When he came across someone he genuinely wanted she became his father s mistress whereupon they both flew to England leaving him to study a war he didn t care about leaving him stranded back where he had started from He started out not caring he wound up not caring One of the doctors did say he believed that Jeff started taking LSD during that period after he left me and before he shot himself That is only a theory However unlike the homosexual theory it may have been true Thousands of young people kill themselves in America each year but it remains the custom by and large to list their deaths as accidental This is to spare the family the shame attached to suicide There is indeed something shameful about a young man or woman maybe an adolescent wanting to die and achieving that goal dead before in a certain sense they ever lived ever were born Wives get beaten by their husbands cops kill blacks and Latinos old people rummage in garbage cans or eat dog food shame rules calling the shots Suicide is only one shameful event out of a plethora There are black teenagers who will never get a job as long as they live not because they are lazy but because there are no jobs because too these ghetto kids possess no skills they can sell Children run away find the strip in New York or Hollywood they become prostitutes and wind up with their bodies hacked apart If the impulse to slay the Spartan runners reporting the battle results the outcome at Thermopylae rises in you by all means slay them I am those runners and I report what you do not want most likely to hear Personally I report only three deaths but three more than were necessary This is the day John Lennon died you wish to slay those who report that too As Sri Krishna says when he assumes his true form his universal form that of time All these hosts must die strike stay your hand no matter Seem to slay By me these men are slain already It is an awful sight Arjuna has seen what he cannot believe exists Licking with your burning tongues Devouring all the worlds You probe the heights of heaven With intolerable beams O Vishnu What Arjuna sees was once his friend and charioteer A man like himself That was only an aspect a kindly disguise Sri Krishna wished to spare him to hide the truth Arjuna asked to see Sri Krishna s true form and he got to see it He will not now be as he was The spectacle has changed him changed him forever This is the true forbidden fruit this kind of knowledge Sri Krishna waited a long time before he showed Arjuna his actual shape He wanted to spare him The true shape that of the universal destroyer emerged at last I would not want to make you unhappy by detailing pain but there is a crucial sort of difference between pain and the narration of pain I am telling you what happened If there is vicarious pain in knowing there is actual peril in not knowing In aversion lies a colossal risk When Kirsten and the bishop had returned to the Bay Area not permanently but rather to deal with Jeff s death and the problems raised by it I could upon seeing them again notice a change in both of them Kirsten looked worn and wretched and this did not seem to me to emanate from the shock of Jeff s death alone Obviously she was in ill health in purely physical terms On the other hand Bishop Archer seemed even more animated than when I had last seen him He took complete charge of the situation regarding Jeff he selected the burial spot the kind of gravestone he delivered the eulogy and all other rites wearing full robes and he paid for everything The inscription on the gravestone came as a result of his inspiration He chose a phrase which I found quite acceptable it is the motto or basic statement of the school of Heraclitus NO SINGLE THING ABIDES BUT ALL THINGS Flow I had been taught in philosophy class that Heraclitus himself invented that but Tim explained that this summation came after Heraclitus by those of his school who followed him They believed that only flux which is to say change is real They may have been right The three of us joined together after the graveside service we returned to the Tenderloin apartment and tried to make ourselves comfortable It took a while for any of us to say anything Tim talked about Satan for some reason Tim had a new theory about Satan s rise and fall that he apparently wanted to try out on us since we Kirsten and I were the closest people at hand I presumed at the time that Tim intended to include his theory in the book he had begun working on I see the legend of Satan in a new way Satan desired to know God as fully as possible The fullest knowledge would come if he became God was himself God He strove for this and achieved it knowing that the punishment would be permanent exile from God But he did it anyhow because the memory of knowing God really knowing him as no one else ever had or would justified to him his eternal punishment Now who would you say truly loved God out of everyone who ever existed Satan willingly accepted eternal punishment and exile just to know God by becoming God for an instant Further it occurs to me Satan truly knew God but perhaps God did not know or understand Satan had He understood him He would not have punished him That is why it is said that Satan rebelled which means Satan was outside of God s control outside God s domain as if in another universe But Satan did I think welcome his punishment for it was his proof to himself that he knew and loved God Otherwise he might have done what he did for the reward had there been a reward Better to rule in hell than to serve in heaven is an issue here but not the true one which is the ultimate goal and search to know and be fully and really to know God in comparison to which all else is really very little Prometheus Kirsten said absently She sat smoking and gazing Tim said Prometheus means Forethinker He was involved in the creating of man He was also the supreme trickster among the gods Pandora was sent down to Earth by Zeus as a punishment to Prometheus for stealing fire and bringing it to man In addition Pandora punished the whole human race Epimetheus married her he was Hindsight Prometheus warned him not to marry Pandora since Prometheus could foresee the consequences This same kind of absolute foreknowledge is or was considered by the Zoroastrians to be an attribute of God the Wise Mind An eagle ate his liver Kirsten said remotely Nodding Tim said Zeus punished Prometheus by chaining him and sending an eagle to eat his liver which regenerated itself endlessly However Hercules released him Prometheus was a friend to mankind beyond any doubt He was a master craftsman There is an affinity to the legend of Satan certainly As I see it Satan could be said to have stolen not fire but true knowledge of God However he did not bring it to man as Prometheus did with fire Perhaps Satan s real sin was that upon acquiring that knowledge he kept it to himself he did not share it with mankind That s interesting by that line of reasoning one could argue that we could acquire a knowledge of God by way of Satan I ve never heard that theory put forth before He became silent apparently pondering Would you write this down he said to Kirsten I ll remember Her tone was listless and drab Man must assault Satan and seize this knowledge Tim said and take it from him Satan does not want to yield it up For concealing it not for taking it in the first place he was punished Then in a sense human beings can redeem Satan by wresting this knowledge from him I said And then go off and study astrology Glancing at me Tim said Pardon Wallenstein I said Off casting horoscopes The Greek words which our word horoscope is based on Tim said are hora which means hour and scopos which means one who watches So horoscope literally means one who watches the hours He lit a cigarette both he and Kirsten since their return from England seemed to smoke constantly Wallenstein was a fascinating person So Jeff says I said Said I mean Cocking his head alertly Tim said Was Jeff interested in Wallenstein Because I have You didn t know I said Looking puzzled Tim said I don't think so Kirsten regarded him steadily with an inscrutable expression I have a number of very good books on Wallenstein Tim said You know in many ways Wallenstein resembled Hitler Both Kirsten and I remained silent Wallenstein contributed to the ruin of Germany Tim said He was a great general Friedrich von Schiller as you may know wrote three plays about Wallenstein whose titles are Wallenstein s Camp The Piccolominis and The Death of Wallenstein They are profoundly moving plays This brings up of course the role of Schiller himself in the development of Western thought Let me read you something Setting his cigarette down Tim went over to the bookcase for a book he found it after a few minutes of hunting This may shed some light on the subject In writing to his friend let me see I have the name here in writing to Wilhelm von Humboldt this was toward the very end of Schiller s life Schiller said After all we are both idealists and should be ashamed to have it said that the material world formed us instead of being formed by us The essence of Schiller s vision was of course freedom He was naturally absorbed in the great drama of the revolt of the Lowlands by that I mean Holland and Tim paused thinking his lips moving he gazed absently off into space On the couch Kirsten sat in silence smoking and staring Well Tim said finally leafing through the book he held let me read you this Schiller wrote this when he was thirty four years old Perhaps it sums up much of our aspirations our most noble ones Peering at the book Tim read aloud Now that I have begun to know and to employ my spiritual powers properly an illness unfortunately threatens to undermine my physical ones However I shall do what I can and when in the end the edifice comes crashing down I shall have salvaged what was worth preserving Tim shut the book and returned it to the shelf We said nothing I did not even think I merely sat Schiller is very important to the twentieth century Tim said he returned to his cigarette stubbed it out For a long time he stared down at the ashtray I'm going to send out for a pizza Kirsten said I'm not up to fixing dinner That s fine Tim said Ask them to put Canadian bacon on it And if they have soft drinks I can fix dinner I said Kirsten rose made her way to the phone leaving Tim and me alone together Earnestly Tim said to me It is really a matter of great importance to know God to discern the Absolute Essence which is the way Heidegger puts it Sein is his term Being What we have uncovered at the Zadokite Wadi simply beggars description I nodded How are you fixed for money Tim said reaching into his coat pocket I'm fine I said you're working still At the real estate He corrected himself you're a legal secretary you're still with them then Yes I said But I'm just a clerk typist I found my career as a lawyer taxing Tim said but rewarding I d advise you to become a legal secretary and then perhaps you can use that as a jumping off platform and go into law become an attorney It might even be possible for you to be a judge someday I guess so I said Tim said Did Jeff discuss the anokhi with you Well you wrote to us And we saw newspaper and magazine articles They used the term in a special sense a technical sense the Zadokites It could not have meant the Divine Intelligence because they speak of having it literally There is one line from Document Six Anokhi dies and is reborn each year and upon each following year anokhi is more Or greater more or greater it could be either perhaps lofty It s extremely puzzling but the translators are working on it and we hope to have it during the next six months and of course they re still piecing together the fragments the scrolls that became mutilated I have no knowledge of Aramaic as you probably realize I studied both Greek and Latin you know God is the final bulwark against non Being Tillich I said Beg pardon Tim said Paul Tillich said that I said I'm not sure about that Tim said It was certainly one of the Protestant existential theologians it may have been Reinhold Niebuhr You know Niebuhr is an American or rather was he died quite recently One thing that interests me about Niebuhr Tim paused a moment Niemoller served in the German navy in World War One He worked actively against the Nazis and continued to preach until The Gestapo arrested him and he was sent to Dachau Niebuhr had been a pacifist originally but urged Christians to support the war against Hitler I feel that one of the significant differences between Wallenstein and Hitler actually it is a very great similarity lies in the loyalty oaths that Wallenstein Excuse me I said I went into the bathroom opened the medicine cabinet to see if the bottle of Dexamyls was still there It was not all the medicine bottles were gone Taken to England I realized Now in Kirsten s and Tim s luggage Fuck When I came out I found Kirsten standing alone in the living room I'm terribly terribly tired she said in a faint voice I can see that I said There is no way I am going to be able to keep down pizza Could you go to the store for me I made a list I want boned chicken the kind that comes in a jar and rice or noodles Here this is the list She handed it to me Tim ll give you the money I have money I returned to the bedroom where I had put my coat and purse As I was putting on my coat Tim appeared from behind me anxious to say something more What Schiller saw in Wallenstein was a man who colluded with fate to bring on his own demise This would be for the German Romantics the greatest sin of all to collude with fate fate regarded as doom He followed me from the bedroom down the hall The whole spirit of Goethe and Schiller and the others their whole orientation was that the human will could overcome fate Fate would not be regarded as inevitable but as something a person allowed Do you see my point To the Greeks fate was ananke a force absolutely predetermined and impersonal they equated it with Nemesis which is retributive punishing fate I'm sorry I said I have to go to the store aren't they bringing the pizza Kirsten s not feeling well Standing close to me and speaking in a low voice Tim said Angel I'm very concerned about her I can t get her to go to a doctor Her stomach either that or her gall bladder Maybe you can convince her to undergo a multiphasic She s afraid of what they ll find You know don't you that she had cervical cancer a number of years ago Yes I said And a hysterocleisis What is that A surgical procedure the mouth of the uterus is closed She has so many anxieties in this area that is pertaining to this topic it s impossible for me to discuss it with her I ll talk to her I said Kirsten blames herself for Jeff s death Shit I said I was afraid of that Coming from the living room Kirsten said to me Add ginger ale to the list I gave you Please Okay I said Is the store Turn right Kirsten said It s four blocks straight and then one block left It s a Chinese run little grocery store but they have what I want Do you need any more cigarettes Tim said Yes you might pick up a carton Kirsten said Any of the low tar brands they all taste the same Okay I said Opening the door for me Tim said I ll drive you The two of us made our way down the sidewalk to his rented car but as we stood he discovered that he did not have the keys We ll have to walk he said So we walked together saying nothing for a time It s a nice night I said finally There s something I ve been meaning to discuss with you Tim said Although technically it s not within your province I didn t know I had a province I said It s not an area of expertise for you I'm not sure who I should talk to about it These Zadokite Documents are in some respects He hesitated I would have to say distressing To me personally is what I mean What the translators have come across is many of the Logia the sayings of Jesus predating Jesus by almost two hundred years I realize that I said But that means Tim said that he was not the Son of God Was not in fact God as the Trinitarian doctrine requires us to believe That may pose no problem for you Angel No not really I agreed The Logia are essential to our understanding and apperception of Jesus as the Christ that is the Messiah or Anointed One If as would now seem to be the case the Logia can be severed from the person Jesus then we must reevaluate the four Gospels not just the Synoptics but all four we must ask ourselves what then we indeed do know about Jesus if indeed we know anything at all Can t you just assume Jesus was a Zadokite I said That was the impression I had gotten from the newspaper and magazine articles Upon the discovery of the Qumran Scrolls the Dead Sea Scrolls there had been an enormous flurry of speculation that Jesus came from or was in some way connected with the Essenes I saw no problem I could not see what Tim was concerned about as the two of us walked slowly along the sidewalk There is a mysterious figure Tim said mentioned in a number of the Zadokite Documents He s referred to by a Hebrew word best translated as Expositor It is this shadowy personage to whom many of the Logia are attributed Well then Jesus learned from him or anyhow they were derived from him I said But then Jesus is not the Son of God He is not God Incarnate God as a human being I said Maybe God revealed the Logia to the Expositor But then the Expositor is the Son of God Okay I said These are problems over which I ve agonized although that is rather a strong term But it bothers me And it should bother me Here we have many of the parables related in the Gospels now extant in scrolls predating Jesus by two hundred years Not all the Logia are represented admittedly but many are many crucial ones Certain cardinal doctrines of resurrection are also present those being expressed in the well known I am utterances by Jesus I am the bread of life I am the Way I am the narrow gate These simply cannot be separated from Jesus Christ Just take that first one I am the bread of life Anyone who does eat my flesh and drink my blood has eternal life and I shall raise him up on the last day For my flesh is real food and my blood is real drink He who eats my flesh and drinks my blood lives in me and I live in him Do you see my point Sure I said The Zadokite Expositor said it first Then the Zadokite Expositor conferred eternal life and specifically through the Eucharist I think that s wonderful I said Tim said It was always the hope but never the expectation that we would someday unearth Q or unearth something that would permit us to reconstruct Q or parts of Q but no one ever dreamed that an Ur Quelle would manifest itself predating Jesus and by two centuries Also there are peculiar other He paused I want to obtain your promise not to discuss what I'm going to say not to talk about it with any one This part hasn t been released to the media May I die horribly Associated with the I am statements are certain very peculiar additions not found in the Gospels and apparently not known to the early Christians At least no written record of their knowing these things believing these things has passed down to us I He broke off The term bread and the term used for blood suggest literal bread and literal blood As if the Zadokites had a specific bread and a specific drink that they prepared and had that constituted in essence the body and blood of what they call the anokhi for whom the Expositor spoke and whom the Expositor represented Well I said I nodded Where is this store Tim looked around Another block or so I said I guess Tim said earnestly Something they drank something they ate As in the Messianic banquet It made them immortal they believed it gave them eternal life this combination of what they ate and what they drank Obviously this prefigures the Eucharist Obviously it s related to the Messianic banquet Anokhi Always that word They ate anokhi and they drank anokhi and as a result they became anokhi They became God Himself Which is what Christianity teaches I said regarding the Mass There are parallels found in Zoroastrianism Tim said The Zoroastrians sacrificed cattle and combined this with an intoxicating drink called haoma But there is no reason to assume that this resulted in a homologizing with the Deity That you see is what the Sacraments achieve for the Christian communicant he or she is homologized to God as represented in and by Christ Becomes God or becomes one with God unified with assimilated to God An apotheosis is what I'm saying But here with the Zadokites you get precisely this with the bread and the drink derived from anokhi and of course the term anokhi itself refers to the Pure Self Awareness which is to say Pure Consciousness of Yahweh the God of the Hebrew people Brahman is that I said I beg your pardon Brahman In India Brahmanism Brahman possesses absolute pure consciousness Pure consciousness pure being pure bliss As I recall But what Tim said is this anokhi that they ate and drank The body and blood of the Lord I said But what is it He gestured It s one thing to say glibly It s the Lord because Angel that is what in logic is called a hysteron proteron fallacy what you are trying to prove is assumed in your premise Obviously it s the body and blood of the Lord the word anokhi makes that clear but it doesn t Oh I see I said then It s circular reasoning In other words you're saying that this anokhi actually exists Tim stopped and stood gazing at me Of course I understand You mean it s real God is real Not really real I said God is a matter of belief It isn t real in the sense that that car I pointed to a parked Trans Am is real You couldn t be more wrong I started to laugh Where did you ever get an idea like that Tim said That God isn t real God is a I hesitated A way of looking at things An interpretation I mean He doesn t exist Not the way objects exist You couldn t say bump into Him like you can bump into a wall Does a magnetic field exist Sure I said You can t bump into it I said But it ll show up if you spread iron filings across a piece of paper The hieroglyphs of God lie all about you Tim said As the world and in the world That s just an opinion It s not my opinion But you can see the world I see the world I said but I don't see any sign of God But there cannot be a creation without a creator Who says it s a creation My point Tim said is that if the Logia predate Jesus by two hundred years then the Gospels are suspect and if the Gospels are suspect we have no evidence that Jesus was God very God God Incarnate and therefore the basis of our religion is gone Jesus simply becomes a teacher representing a particular Jewish sect that ate and drank some kind of well whatever it was the anokhi and it made them immortal They believed it made them immortal I corrected him That s not the same thing People believe that herbal remedies can cure cancer but that doesn t make it true We arrived at the little grocery store and stood momentarily I take it you're not a Christian Tim said Tim I said you ve known that for years I'm your daughter in law I'm not sure I'm a Christian I'm now not sure there in fact is such a thing as Christianity And I ve got to get up and tell people I have to go on with my ministerial and pastoral duties Knowing what I know Knowing that Jesus was a teacher and not God and not even an original teacher what he taught was the aggregate belief system of an entire sect A group product I said It could still have come from God God could have revealed it to the Zadokites What else does it say about the Expositor He returns in the Final Days and acts as Eschatological Judge That s fine I said That s found in Zoroastrianism also Tim said So much seems to go back to the Iranian religions the Jews developed a distinct Iranian quality to their religion during the time He broke off he had turned inward mentally oblivious now to me to the store our errand I said trying to cheer him up Maybe the scholars and translators will find some of this anokhi Find God he echoed to himself Find it growing A root or a tree Why do you say that He seemed angry What would make you say that Bread has to be made out of something You can t eat bread unless it s made from something Jesus was speaking metaphorically He did not mean literal bread Maybe he didn t but the Zadokites apparently did That thought crossed my mind Some of the translators are proposing that That a literal bread and a literal drink is signified I am the gate of the sheepfold Jesus certainly did not mean he was made of wood I am the true vine and my father is the vinedresser Every branch in me that bears no fruit he cuts away and every branch that does bear fruit he prunes to make it bear even more Well it s a vine then I said Look for a vine That s absurd and carnal Why I said Tim said savagely I am the vine you are the branches Are we to assume that a literal plant is referred to That this is a physical not a spiritual matter Something growing in the Dead Sea Desert He gestured I am the light of the world Are we to assume you could read a newspaper by holding it up to him Like this streetlight Maybe so I said Dionysos was a vine in a manner of speaking His worshippers got drunk and then Dionysos possessed them and they ran over the hills and fields and bit cows to death Devoured whole animals alive There are certain resemblances Tim said Together we continued on into the little grocery store BEFORE TIM AND KIRSTEN could return to England the Episcopal Synod of Bishops convened to look into the matter of his possible heresies The jerk off I should say I suppose conservative that is the more polite term bishops who stood as his accusers proved themselves idiots in terms of their ability to mount a successful attack on him Tim emerged from the Synod officially vindicated It made the newspapers and magazines of course Never at any time had this subject worried him Anyhow due to Jeff s suicide Tim had plenty of public sympathy He had always had that but now because of the tragedy in his personal life he had it even more Somewhere Plato says that if you are going to shoot at a king you must be sure you kill him The conservative bishops in failing to destroy Tim left him as a result even stronger than ever which is the way with defeat we say about such a turn of events that it has backfired Tim knew now that no one within the Episcopal Church of the United States of America could bring him down If he were to be destroyed he would have to do it himself As for myself in regard to my own life I owned the house that Jeff and I had been buying Jeff had made out a will due to his father s insistence I did not acquire much but I acquired what there was Since I had supported Jeff and myself no financial problems confronted me I continued to work at the law office and candle shop For a time I believed that with Jeff dead I would gradually lose touch with Tim and Kirsten That did not turn out to be the case Tim seemed to find in me someone he could talk to After all I was one of the few people who knew the story about his relationship with his general secretary and business agent And of course I had brought him and Kirsten together Beyond that Tim did not jettison people who had become his friends I amounted to much more than that anyhow a great deal of love existed between the two of us and out of that had come an understanding We were literally good friends in a sort of traditional way The Bishop of California who held so many radical views and advanced such wild theories was in his immediate life an old fashioned human being in the best sense of the term If you were his friend he became loyal to you and stayed loyal to you as I informed Ms Marion years later long after Kirsten and Tim were like my husband dead It is a forgotten matter about Bishop Archer that he loved his friends and stuck with them even if he had nothing to gain in the sense that they had or did not have some power to advance his career to enhance his station or advantage him in the practical world All I amounted to in that world was a young woman working as a clerical secretary in a law office and not an important law office Tim had nothing to gain strategically by maintaining our relationship but he maintained it up until his death Kirsten during this period following Jeff s death showed progressive symptoms of a deteriorating physical condition which finally the doctors diagnosed correctly as peritonitis from which you can die The bishop paid all her medical expenses which came to a staggering sum for ten days she languished in the intensive care unit of one of the best hospitals in San Francisco complaining bitterly that no one visited her or gave a good goddamn Tim who flew all around the United States lecturing saw her as often as he could but it was not nearly often enough to suit her I came over to the city to see her as frequently as possible With me as with Tim it was in her opinion far too inadequate a response to her illness Most of the time I spent with her amounted to a one way diatribe in which she complained about him and about all else in life She had aged It strikes me as semi meaningless to say You are only as old as you feel because in point of fact age and illness are going to win out and this stupid statement only resonates with people in good health who have not undergone the sort of traumas that Kirsten Lundborg had Her son Bill had disclosed an infinite capacity to be crazy and for this Kirsten felt responsible she knew too that a major factor in Jeff s suicide had been her relationship with his father That made her bitterly severe toward me as if guilt her guilt goaded her into chronically abusing me the chief victim of Jeff s death We really did not have much of a friendship left she and I Nevertheless I visited her in the hospital and I always dressed up so that I looked great and I always brought her something she could not eat if it was food or could not wear or use They won t let me smoke she said to me one time by way of a greeting Of course not I said You ll set your bed on fire again Like you did that time She had almost suffocated herself a few weeks before going into the hospital Kirsten said Get me some yarn Yam I said I'm going to knit a sweater For the bishop Her tone withered the word Kirsten managed to convey through words a kind of antagonism one rarely encountered The bishop she said needs a sweater Her animosity centered on the fact that Tim had proved able to handle his affairs quite well in her absence at the moment he was all the way up in Canada somewhere delivering a speech It had been Kirsten s contention for some time that Tim could not survive a week without her Her confinement in the hospital had proven her wrong Why don't Mexicans want their children to marry blacks Kirsten said Because their kids would be too lazy to steal I said When does a black man become a nigger When he leaves the room I seated myself in a plastic chair facing her bed What s the safest time to drive your car I said Kirsten gave me a hostile glance You ll be out of here soon I said to help her cheer up I ll never be out of here The bishop is probably never mind Grabbing ass in Montreal Or wherever he is You know he had me in bed the second time we met And the first time was at a restaurant in Berkeley I was there So he couldn t do it the first time If he could have he would have Doesn t that surprise you about a bishop There are a few things I could tell you but I won t She ceased speaking then and glowered Good I said Good what That I'm not going to tell you If you start telling me I said I will get up and leave My therapist told me to set clear limits with you Oh that s right you're another of them Who s in therapy You and my son You two ought to get together You could make clay snakes in occupational therapy I am leaving I said I stood up Oh Christ Kirsten said irritably Sit down I said What became of the Swedish mongoloid cretin who escaped from the asylum in Stockholm I don't know They found him teaching school in Norway Laughing Kirsten said Go fuck yourself I don't have to I'm doing fine Probably so She nodded I wish I was back in London You ve never been to London There wasn t enough money I said In the Bishop s Discretionary Fund For Jeff and me Oh that s right I used it all up Most of it Kirsten said I got to go nowhere While Tim hung around those old faggot translators Did he tell you that Jesus is a fake Amazing Here we find out two thousand years later that somebody else entirely made up all those Logia and all those I am statements I never saw Tim so downcast he just sat and stared at the floor in our flat day after day To that I said nothing Do you think it matters Kirsten said That Jesus was a fake Not to me it doesn t I said They haven t really published the important part About the mushroom They re keeping that secret for as long as they can However What mushroom The anokhi I said incredulous The anokhi is a mushroom It s a mushroom It was a mushroom back then They grew it in caves the Zadokites Jesus Christ I said They made mushroom bread out of it They made a broth from it and drank the broth ate the bread drank the broth That s where the two species of the Host come from the body and the blood Apparently the anokhi mushroom was toxic but the Zadokites found a way to detoxify it at least somewhat enough so it didn t kill them It made them hallucinate I started laughing Then they were a Yes they turned on Kirsten too now laughed in spite of herself And Tim has to get up every Sunday at Grace and give Communion knowing that knowing they were simply getting off on a psychedelic trip like the kids in the Haight Ashbury I thought it was going to kill him when he found out So then Jesus was in effect a dope dealer I said She nodded The Twelve the disciples were this is the theory smuggling the anokhi into Jerusalem and they got caught This just confirms what John Allegro figured out if you happened to see his book He s one of the greatest scholars vis à vis Near Eastern languages he was the official translator of the Qumran scrolls I didn t see his book I said but I know who he is Jeff used to talk about him Allegro figured out that the early Christians were a secret mushroom cult he deduced it from internal evidence in the New Testament And he found a fresco or wall painting anyhow a picture of early Christians with a huge amania muscaria mushroom Amanita muscaria I corrected It s the red one They are terribly toxic So the early Christians found a way to detoxify it then That s Allegro s contention And they saw cartoons She began to giggle Is there actually an anokhi mushroom I said I knew something about mushrooms before I married Jeff I had gone with an amateur mycologist Well there probably was but nobody today knows what it would be So far in the Zadokite Documents there s no description No way to tell which one it was or if it still exists I said Maybe it did more than cause hallucinations Like what A nurse came over to me at that point You ll have to leave now Okay I rose gathered up my coat and purse Kirsten said Bend over She waved me toward her in a whisper directly into my ear she said Orgies After kissing her good bye I left the hospital When I arrived back in Berkeley and had made my way by bus to the little old farmhouse that Jeff and I had been living in I saw as I walked up the path a young man crouched over in the corner of the porch I halted warily wondering who he was Pudgy with light colored hair he bent stroking my cat Magnificat who had curled up happily against the front door of the house I watched for a time thinking Is this a salesman or something The young man wore trousers too large for him and a brightly colored shirt On his face as he petted Magnificat was the most gentle expression I had ever seen on a human face this kid who obviously had never encountered my cat before radiated a kind of fondness a kind of palpable love that in fact was something new to me Some of the very early statues of the god Apollo reveal that sweet smile Totally absorbed in petting Magnificat the kid remained oblivious to me to my nearby presence I watched fascinated because for one thing Magnificat was a rough and tumble old tomcat who normally did not allow strangers to get near him All at once the kid glanced up He smiled shyly and rose awkwardly to his feet Hi Hi I walked toward him carefully very slowly I found this cat The kid blinked still smiling he had guileless blue eyes absent of any cunning It s my cat I said What s her name It s a tomcat I said and he s named Magnificat He s very beautiful the kid said Who are you I said I'm Kirsten s son I'm Bill That explained the blue eyes and the blond hair I'm Angel Archer I said I know We ve met But it was He hesitated I'm not sure how long ago They gave me electroshock my memory isn t very good Yes I said I guess we did meet I just came from the hospital visiting your mom Can I use your bathroom Sure I said I got my keys from my purse and unlocked the front door Excuse the mess I work I'm not home enough to keep it neat The bathroom is off the kitchen in the back Just keep on going Bill Lundborg did not close the bathroom door behind him I could hear him urinating loudly I filled the tea kettle and put it on the burner Strange I thought This is the son she derides As she derides us all Reappearing Bill Lundborg stood self consciously smiling at me anxiously quite obviously ill at ease He had not flushed the toilet I thought then very suddenly He has just come out of the hospital the mental hospital I can tell Would you like coffee I said Sure Magnificat entered the kitchen How old is she Bill asked I have no idea how old he is I rescued him from a dog After he had grown I mean not as a kitten He probably lived somewhere in the neighborhood How is Kirsten Doing really well I said I pointed to a chair Sit down Thanks He seated himself placing his arms on the kitchen table he interlocked his fingers His skin was so pale Kept indoors I thought Caged up I like your cat You can feed him I said I opened the refrigerator and got out the can of cat food As Bill fed Magnificat I watched the two of them The care he took in spooning out the food systematically his attention deeply fixed as if it were very important what he had become involved in he kept his gaze intent on Magnificat and as he scrutinized the old cat he smiled again that smile that so touched me so made me start Batter me oh God I thought remembering for some strange reason Batter and kill me they have injured this sweet kind baby until there is almost nothing left Burned his circuits out as a pretense of healing him The fucking sadists I thought in their sterile coats What do they know about the human heart I felt like crying And he will be back in I thought as Kirsten says In and out of the hospital the rest of his life The fucking sons of bitches Batter my heart three person d God for you As yet but knocke breathe shine and seeke to mend That I may rise and stand o erthrow mee and bend Your force to breake blowe burn and make me new I like an usurpt town to another due Labour to admit you but Oh to no end Reason your viceroy in mee mee should defend But is captiv d and proves weake or untrue Yet dearely I love you and would be loved faine But am betroth d unto your enemie Divorce mee untie or breake that knot againe Take awe to you imprison mee for I Except you enthrall mee never shall be free Nor ever chaste except you ravish mee My favorite poem of John Donne s it came up into me into my mind as I watched Bill Lundborg feed my worn old cat And I laugh at God I thought I make no sense out of what Tim teaches and believes and the torment he feels over these various issues I am fooling myself in my own labored way I do understand Look at him serve that ignorant cat He this child would have been a veterinarian if they hadn t maimed him shredded up his mind What had Kirsten told me He is afraid to drive he stops taking out the garbage he will not bathe and then he cries I cry too I thought and sometimes I let the trash pile up and one time I nearly got sideswiped on Hoffman and had to pull over Lock me up I thought lock up us all This then is Kirsten s affliction having this boy for her son Bill said Is there anything else I can feed her She s still hungry Anything you see in the fridge I said Would you like something to eat No thanks Again he stroked the awful old cat a cat who never gave the time of day to any person He has made this animal tame I thought as he himself is tame Did you come here on the bus I said Yes He nodded I had to surrender my driver s license I used to drive but He became silent I take the bus I said I had a real great car Bill said A Chevy A stick shift with an eight the big eight they made it was only the second year Chevrolet made an eight the first year was Those are very valuable cars I said Yes Chevrolet had changed to that new body style After the old higher shorter body style they used so long The difference between a and a Chevy is in the front grille if the grille includes the turn signal lights you can tell it s a Where are you living I said In the City I'm not living anywhere I got out of Napa last week They let me out because Kirsten is sick I hitched down here A man gave me a ride in his Stingray He smiled You have to take those Vettes out on the freeway every week or they build up carbon deposits in the mill He was blowing carbon out the whole way What I don't like about a Vette is the fiberglass body you can t really repair it He added But they certainly are good looking His was white I forget the year although he told me We got it up to a hundred but the cops pace you a lot when you're in a Vette hoping you ll exceed the limit We had a Highway Patrol after us part of the way but he had to turn his siren on and take off an emergency of some kind somewhere We flipped him off as he went by He was real disgusted but he couldn t cite us he was in too much of a hurry I asked him then as tactfully as I could why he had come to see me I wanted to ask you something Bill said I met your husband one time You weren t home you were working or something He was here alone Was his name Jeff Yes I said What I wanted to know is Bill hesitated Could you tell me why he killed himself There are a lot of factors involved in something like that I seated myself at the kitchen table facing him I know he was in love with my mother Oh I said You do know that Yes Kirsten told me Was that the main reason Perhaps I said What were the other reasons I was silent Would you tell me one thing Bill said one particular thing Was he mentally disturbed He had been in therapy But not intensive therapy I ve been thinking about it Bill said He was mad at his father because of Kirsten A lot of it had to do with that See when you're in the hospital a mental hospital you know a lot of people who ve tried suicide Their wrists are all sawed on That s always the way you can tell The best way when you do that is up the arm in the direction the veins run He showed me his bare arm pointing The mistake most people make is cutting at right angles to the vein down at the wrist We had this one guy he laid open his arm for like about seven inches and He paused calculating Maybe as much as a quarter inch wide But they still were able to sew it up He had been in for months He said one time in group therapy that all he wanted to be was a pair of eyes bugging out from the wall so he could see everyone but no one could see him Just an observer not a part of what was going on ever Just watching and listening He would have to be a pair of ears too to do that For the life of me I could think of nothing to say Paranoids have a fear of being looked at Bill said So invisibility would be important to them There was this one lady she couldn t eat in front of anyone She always took her tray off to her room I guess she thought eating was dirty He smiled I managed to smile back How strange this is I thought An eerie conversation as if it is not actually taking place Jeff was real hostile Bill said Toward his father and toward Kirsten both and maybe toward you but I don't think as much toward you I mean We talked about you that day I came over I forget when that was I had a two day pass I hitched down then too It s not that hard to hitch A truck picked me up even though it had a NO RIDERS sign posted It was carrying some kind of chemicals but not the toxic kind If they re carrying flammable material or toxic material they know not to give you a ride because if there is an accident and you're killed or poisoned then sometimes it voids their insurance Again I could think of nothing to say I nodded The law Bill said in case of an accident where a hitchhiker is injured or killed is that it s presumed he rode at his own risk He took the chance So because of that when you hitch if something happens you can t sue That s California law I don't know how it is in other states Yes I said Jeff felt a lot of anger toward Tim Do you feel animosity toward my mother After a pause after I had thought it over I said Yes I really do Why It wasn t her fault Any time a person kills himself he has to take full responsibility We learned that You learn a lot in the hospital You know a whole bunch of things that people on the outside never find out It s a crash course in reality which is the ultimate He gestured Paradox Because the people there are there because presumably they don't face reality and then they wind up in the hospital the mental hospital a state hospital like Napa and have to face a whole lot more reality all of a sudden than other people ever have to do And they face it very well I ve seen things I have been very proud of patients helping other patients One time this lady she was like about in her fifties said to me Can I confide in you She swore me to secrecy I promised not to say anything She said I'm going to kill myself tonight She told me how she was going to do it This was not a locked ward She had her car parked out in the lot and she had an ignition key they didn t know she had they the staff thought they had all her keys but she kept this one back So I thought it over about what I should do Should I tell Dr Gutman He was in charge of the ward What I did was I sneaked outside onto the lot I knew which car was hers and I removed the coil wire that runs well you wouldn t know It runs between the coil and the distributor There s no way you can start an engine with that wire missing It s easy to do When you park your car in a really rough neighborhood and you're afraid someone will steal it you can pull out that wire it comes out real easy She cranked it until the battery ran down and then she came back in She was furious but later on she thanked me He pondered and then said half to himself She was going to ram an ongoing car on the Bay Bridge So I saved him too the other car It might have been like a station wagon full of kids My God I said faintly It was a decision I had to make in a hurry Bill said Once I knew she had that key I had to do something It was a big Merc Silver colored Almost new She had a lot of money In a situation like that if you don't act it s the same as helping them I said It might have been better to tell the doctor No He shook his head Then she would have well it s hard to explain She knew that I did it to save her life not to get her in trouble If I had told the staff especially if I had told Dr Gutman she would have interpreted that as me just trying to get her kept there another couple of months But this way they never knew so they didn t hold her any longer than they originally intended to When I got out she got out before I did one time she came by my apartment I gave her my address anyhow she came by she was driving that same Merc I recognized it when she pulled up and she wanted to know how I was getting along How were you getting along I said Not good at all I didn t have money to pay my rent they were going to evict me She had a whole lot of money her husband was rich They owned a bunch of apartment buildings up and down California as far down as San Diego She went back to her car and came back and handed me a roll of what I thought were nickels You know a roll of coins After she left I opened the roll at one end and they were gold coins She told me later she kept a lot of her money in the form of gold It was from some British colony She told me when I sold them to a coin dealer to specify that they were B U That stands for bright uncirculated It s a dealers term A bright uncirculated coin is worth more than whatever the opposite would be I got about twelve dollars a coin when I sold them I kept one but I lost it I got something like six hundred dollars for the roll with that one coin missing Turning he scrutinized the stove Your water s boiling I poured the water into the Silex coffee pot Unboiled coffee Bill said filtered coffee is a lot better for you than the percolated kind where it shoots back up to the top and starts all over again That s true I said Bill said I ve been thinking a lot about your husband s death He seemed like a really nice person Sometimes that s a problem Why I said Much mental illness stems from people repressing their hostility and trying to be nice too nice The hostility can t be repressed forever Everybody has it it has to come out Jeff was very calm I said It was hard to get him to fight Marital quarrels I was usually the one who got mad Kirsten says he had been dropping acid I don't think that s true I said That he dropped acid A lot of people who get messed up get messed up from drugs You see a lot of them in the hospital They don't always stay that way contrary to what you hear Most of it is due to malnutrition people on drugs forget to eat and when they do eat they eat junk food The muscles Everyone who does drugs gets the munchies unless of course they re taking amphetamines in which case they don't eat at all Much of what looks like toxic brain psychosis in speed freaks is in fact a deficiency in their galvanic electrolytes Which are easily replaced What sort of work do you do I said He seemed less ill at ease now More confident in what he was saying I'm a painter Bill said What artist is your work Car painting He smiled gently Spray painting At Leo Shine s In San Mateo I ll spray your car any color you want it for forty nine fifty and give you a written six month guarantee He laughed and I laughed too I had seen Leo Shine s commercials on TV I loved my husband very much I said Was he going to be a minister No I don't know what he was going to be Maybe he wasn t going to be anything I'm taking a course in computer programming Right now I'm studying algorithms An algorithm is nothing but a recipe like when you bake a cake It is a sequence of incremental steps sometimes utilizing built in repeats certain steps have to be reiterated One primary aspect of an algorithm is that it be meaningful it s very easy to unintentionally ask a computer a question it can t answer not because it s dumb but because the question really has no answer I see I said Would you consider this a meaningful question Bill said Give me the highest number short of two Yes I said That s meaningful It s not He shook his head There is no such number I know the number I said It s one point nine plus I broke off You would have to carry the sequence of digits into infinity The question is not intelligible So the algorithm is faulty you're asking the computer to do something that can t be done Unless your algorithm is intelligible the computer can t respond but it will attempt to respond by and large Garbage in I said garbage out Right He nodded I'm going to ask you a question I said In return I'm going to give you a proverb a common proverb If you are not familiar with the proverb How much time will I have This isn t timed Just tell me what the proverb means A new broom sweeps clean What does that mean After a pause Bill said It means that old brooms wear out and you have to throw them away I said The burnt child is afraid of fire Again he was silent a moment his forehead wrinkling Children easily get hurt especially around a stove Like this stove here He indicated my kitchen stove It never rains but it pours But I could tell already Bill Lundborg had a thinking impairment he could not explain the proverb instead he repeated it back in concrete terms the terms in which it itself had been phrased Sometimes he said haltingly there s a lot of rain Especially when you don't expect it Vanity thy name is woman Women are vain That s not a proverb It s a quotation from something you're right I said You did fine But in truth in very truth as Tim would say as Jesus used to say or the Zadokites said this person was totally schizophrenic according to the Benjamin Proverb Test I felt a vague haunting ache realizing this seeing him sit there so young and physically healthy and so unable to desymbolize to think abstractly He had the classic schizophrenic cognitive impairment his ratiocination was limited to the concrete You can forget about being a computer programmer I said to myself You will be spray painting low rider cars until the Eschatological judge arrives and frees us one and all from our cares Frees you and frees me frees everyone And then your damaged mind will presumably be healed Cast into a passing pig to be run over the edge of a cliff to doom Where it belongs Excuse me I said I walked from the kitchen through the house to the farthest point from Bill Lundborg possible leaned against the wall with my face pressed into my arm I could feel my tears against my skin warm tears but I made no sound I VIEWED MYSELF as Jeff weeping off by myself in the margins of the house weeping over someone I cared about Where is this going to end I wondered It has to end And it seems not to have an end it just goes on a sequence of explosions like Bill Lundborg s computer trying to figure out what the highest number less than an integer is a hopeless task Not long thereafter Kirsten came out of the hospital she gradually recovered from her digestive ailment upon which cure having happened she and Tim returned to England Before they left the United States I found out from her that her son Bill had gone to jail The U S Postal Service had hired him and then fired him his response to being fired had been to smash the plate glass windows of the San Mateo substation He smashed them with his bare knuckles Obviously he was crazy again If it could be said at any time that he was ever not So I lost track of everyone I did not see Bill again after that day he visited me I saw Kirsten and Tim a number of times Kirsten more often than Tim and then I found myself alone and not very happy and wondering and speculating about the sense underlying the world assuming that any sense existed Like Bill Lundborg s periods of sanity it was a dubitable thing The law office and candle shop one day ceased to be in business My two employers got busted on drug charges I had foreseen it More money could be made in the sale of cocaine than in the sale of candles Cocaine at that time did not enjoy the fad popularity that it enjoys now but the demand even so amounted to an inducement that my employers could not refuse The authorities managed to accommodate them in their inability to say no to big bucks each man got a five year prison term I drifted for a few months drawing unemployment compensation and then I squeezed in as a retail record clerk at the Musik Shop on Telegraph Avenue near Charming Way which is where I work now Psychosis takes many forms You can be psychotic about everything or you can concentrate on one particular topic Bill represented ubiquitous dementia madness had infiltrated every part of his life or so I presume The fixed idea kind of madness is fascinating if you are inclined toward viewing with interest something that is palpably impossible and yet nonetheless exists Over valence is a notion about possibilities in the human mind possibilities of something going wrong that did it not exist it could not be supposed I mean by this simply that you have to see an over valent idea at work fully to appreciate it The older term is idee fire Over valent idea expresses it better because this is a term derived from mechanics and chemistry and biology it is a graphic term and it involves the notion of power The essence of valence is power and that is what I am talking about I speak of an idea that once it comes into the human mind the mind I mean of a given human being it not only never goes away it also consumes everything else in the mind so that finally the person is gone the mind as such is gone and only the over valent idea remains How does such a thing begin When does it begin Jung speaks somewhere I forget which of his books it is mentioned in but anyhow he speaks in one place of a person a normal person into whose mind one day a certain idea comes and that idea never goes away Moreover Jung says upon the entering of that idea into the person s mind nothing new ever happens to that mind or in that mind time stops for that mind and it is dead The mind as a living growing entity has died And yet the person in a sense continues on Sometimes I guess an over valent idea enters the mind as a problem or imaginary problem This is not so rare You are getting ready for bed late at night and all of a sudden the idea comes into your mind that you did not shut off your car lights You look out the window at your car which is parked in your driveway in plain sight and you can see that it shows no lights But then you think Maybe I left the lights on and they stayed on so long that they ran the battery down So to be sure I must go out and check You put on your robe and go out unlock the car door get in and pull on the headlight switch The lights come on You turn them off get out lock up the car and return to the house What has happened is that you have gone crazy you have become psychotic Because you have discounted the testimony of your senses you could see out the window that the car lights were not on yet you went out to check anyhow This is the cardinal factor you saw but you did not believe Or conversely you did not see something but you believed it anyhow Theoretically you could travel between your bedroom and the car forever trapped in an eternal closed loop of unlocking the car trying the light switch returning to the house in this regard you herewith are a machine You are no longer human Also the over valent idea can arise not as a problem or imaginary problem but as a solution If it arises as a problem your mind will fight it off because no one really wants or enjoys problems but if it arises as a solution a spurious solution of course then you will not fight it off because it has a high utility value it is something you need and you have conjured it up to fill this need There exists very little likelihood that you will travel in a loop between your parked car and your bedroom for the rest of your life but there is a very great possibility that if you are tormented by guilt and pain and self doubt and vast floods of self accusations that hit every day without fail that a fixed idea as solution will once it is happened upon remain This is what I next saw with Kirsten and with Tim upon their return to the United States from England their second return after Kirsten got out of the hospital During the period that they lived in London that second time an idea an over valent idea one day came into their minds and that was that Kirsten flew back several days before Tim I did not meet her at the airport I met her at her room on the top floor of the St Francis on the same noble hill of San Francisco that Grace Cathedral itself enjoys I found her busily unpacking her many bags and I thought My God how young she looks In contrast to the last time I saw her she glows What has happened Fewer lines marred her face she moved with deft flexibility and when I entered the room she glanced up and smiled at me with none of the sour overtones the various latent accusations I had become familiar with Hi she said Boy do you look great I said She nodded I quit smoking She lifted a wrapped package from a suitcase open before her on the bed I brought you a couple of things More are on the way by surface mail I could only fit these in Do you want to open them now I can t get over how good you look I said don't you think I ve lost weight She went over to stand before one of the suite s mirrors Something like that I said I have a huge steamer trunk coming by ship Oh you ve seen it You helped me pack I ve got a lot to tell you On the phone you hinted Yes Kirsten said She seated herself on the bed reached for her purse opened it and took out a package of Player s Cigarettes smiling at me she lit a cigarette I thought you quit I said Reflexively she put out the cigarette I still do it now and then out of habit She continued to smile at me in a wild yet veiled mysterious way Well what is it I said Look over there on the table I looked A large notebook lay on the table Open it Kirsten said Okay I picked the notebook up and opened it Some of the pages showed nothing but most of them had been scribbled on in Kirsten s handwriting Kirsten said Jeff has come back to us From the other world Had I said then at that moment Lady you are totally crazy it would have made no difference and I do not castigate myself because I failed to say it Oh I said nodding Well what do you know I tried to read her handwriting but I could not What do you mean I said Phenomena Kirsten said That s what Tim and I call them He sticks needles under my fingernails at night and he sets all the clocks to six thirty which was the exact moment he died Gee I said We ve kept a record Kirsten said We didn t want to tell you in a letter or over the phone we wanted to tell you face to face So I waited until now She raised her arms in excitement Angel he came back to us Well I ll be fucked I said mechanically Hundreds of incidents Hundreds of the phenomena Let s go down to the bar It started right away after we got back to England Tim went to a medium The medium said it was true We knew it was true nobody had to tell us but we wanted to be really certain because we thought possibly just possibly it was only a poltergeist But it isn t It s Jeff Hot damn I said Do you think I'm joking No I said with sincerity Because we both witnessed it And the Winchells saw it too our friends in London And now that we re back in the United States we want you to witness it and record it for Tim s new book He s writing a book about it because this has meaning not just for us but for everyone because it proves that man exists in the other world after he dies here Yes I said Let s go down to the bar Tim s book is called From the Other World He s already gotten a ten thousand dollar advance on it his editor thinks it ll be his bestselling book by far I stand before you amazed I said I know you don't believe me Her tone now had become wooden and edged with anger Why would it enter my head not to believe you I said Because people don't have faith Maybe after I read the notebook He Jeff set fire to my hair sixteen times Wow And he shattered all the mirrors in our flat Not once but several times We would get up and find them broken but we didn t hear it neither of us heard anything Dr Mason he s the medium we went to said that Jeff wants us to understand that he forgives us And he forgives you too Oh I said don't be sarcastic with me Kirsten said I ll really truly try not to be sarcastic I said It is as you can see a great surprise to me I am left without words I ll certainly recover later on I moved toward the door Edgar Barefoot in one of his lectures on KPFA discussed a form of inferential logic developed in India by the Hindu school It is very old and has been much studied not just in India but also in the West It is the second means of knowledge by which man obtains accurate cognition and is called anumana which is Sanskrit for Measuring along some other thing inference It has five stages and I will not go into it because it is difficult but what is important about it is that if these five stages are correctly carried out and the system contains safeguards by which one can determine precisely whether he has indeed carried them out one is assured of going from premise to correct conclusion What especially dignifies anumana is step three the illustration udaharana it requires what is called an invariable concomitance vyapti literally pervasion The anumana form of inferential reasoning will only work if you can be absolutely certain that you indeed possess a vyapti not a concomitance but an invariable concomitance for example late at night you hear a loud sharp echoing popping sound you say to yourself That must be an auto backfiring because when an auto backfires such a sound is created This precisely is where inferential reasoning reasoning that is from effect back to cause breaks down This is why in the West many logicians feel that inductive reasoning as such is suspect that only deductive reasoning can be relied on The Indian anumana strives for what is called a sufficient ground the illustration requires an actual not assumed observation at all times holding that no concomitance can be assumed which fails to be exemplified We in the West have no syllogism exactly equal to the anumana and it is a shame that we do not because had we such a rigorous form by which to check our inductive reasoning Bishop Timothy Archer might well know of it and had he known of it he would have known that his mistress waking up to find her hair singed does not in fact prove that the spirit of his dead son has returned from the other world from in essence beyond the grave Bishop Archer could and did fling around such terms as hysteron proteron because that logical fallacy is known in Greek which is to say Western thought But the anumana is from India The Hindu logicians distinguished a typical fallacious ground that wrecked the anumana they called it hetvabhasa merely the appearance of a ground and this deals with only one step in the anumana out of five They found all sorts of ways to fuck up this five stage structure any one of which a man with Bishop Archer s intelligence and education would have or should have been able to follow That he could believe that a few weird unexplained events proved that Jeff was not only still alive somewhere but communicating with the living somehow shows that like Wallenstein with his astrological charts during the Thirty Years War the faculty of accurate cognition is variable and depends in the final analysis on what you want to believe not what is so A Hindu logician living centuries ago could have seen at a glance the basic fallacy in the reasoning that argued for Jeff s immortality Thus the will to believe chases out the rational mind when ever and wherever the two come into conflict This is all I can assume based on what I now was seeing I suppose we all do it and do it often but this was too glaring too basic to ignore Kirsten s lunatic son palpably schizophrenic could show why asking a computer for the largest number short of two is an unintelligible request but Bishop Timothy Archer a lawyer a scholar a sane adult could see a pin on the bedsheet beside his mistress and leap to the conclusion that his dead son was communicating with him from another world moreover Tim was writing it all up in a book a book that would first be published and then read he not only believed nonsense he believed it in a public way Wait ll the world hears about this Bishop Archer and his mistress declared Winning the heresy confrontation perhaps had convinced the bishop that he could not err or if he erred no one could pull him down He was wrong in both respects he could err and there were people who could pull him down He could pull himself down for that matter I saw all this clearly as I sat with Kirsten at one of the bars in the St Francis Hotel that day And there was nothing I could do Their fixed idea being not a problem but a solution could not be reasoned away even though finally it amounted to a further problem on its own They had tried to solve one problem with yet another That is not how you do it you do not solve one problem with another greater problem This is how Hitler who uncannily resembled Wallenstein had tried to win World War Two Tim could admonish me about hysteron proteron reasoning to his heart s content and then fall victim to the merely occult nonsense stuff of popular paperback books He might as well have believed that Jeff had been brought back by ancient astronauts from another star system I hurt thinking about this I hurt in my legs I hurt throughout Bishop Archer who hysteron proteroned me up and down the street he being a bishop I being a young woman with a B A from Cal in liberal arts I had one night heard Edgar Barefoot talk about this anumana Hindu thing and I knew more or could do more than the Bishop of California and it didn t matter because the Bishop of California was not going to listen to me any more than he was going to listen to anybody else over and beyond his mistress who like himself was so steeped in guilt and so messed up by intrigue and deceit emanating from their invisible relationship that they had long since ceased to be able to reason properly Bill Lundborg shut up in jail now could have set them straight A taxi driver picked at random could have told them they were calculatedly destroying their lives not just by believing this although that alone was sufficiently destructive but by deciding to publish it Fine Do it Wreck your goddamn life Cast charts of the stars cast horoscopes while the most destructive war in modern times is raging It will earn you a place in the history books as a dunce You get to sit on the tall stool in the corner you get to wear the conical cap you get to undo all the social activist shit you ever engineered in concert with some of the finest minds of the century For this Dr Martin Luther King Jr died For this you marched at Selma to believe and to say publicly that you believe that the ghost of your dead son is pushing pins under the fingernails of your mistress while she is asleep By all means publish it Be my guest The logical error of course is that Kirsten and Tim reasoned backward from effect to cause they did not see the cause they saw only what they called phenomena and from these phenomena they inferred Jeff as the secret cause operating in or from the other world The anumana structure shows that this inductive reasoning is not reasoning at all with the anumana you begin with a premise and work through the five steps to your conclusion and each step is airtight in relation to the step before it and the step after it but there is no airtight logic involved in inferring that broken mirrors and singed hair and stopped clocks and all that other crap reveals and in fact proves another reality in which the dead are not dead what it proves is that you are credulous and you are operating at a six year old level mentally you are not reality testing you are lost in wish fulfillment in autism But it is an eerie kind of autism because it revolves around a single idea it does not invade your general field your total attention Outside of this one spurious premise this one faulty induction you are clear headed and sane It is a localized madness allowing you to speak and act normally the rest of the time Therefore no one locks you up because you can still earn a living take baths drive a car take out the trash You are not crazy in the manner that Bill Lundborg is crazy and in a certain sense depending on how you define crazy you are not crazy at all Bishop Archer could still perform his pastoral chores Kirsten could still buy clothes at the best stores in San Francisco Neither of them would smash the windows of a U S Postal Service substation with their bare fists You cannot arrest someone for believing that his son is communicating to this world from the next or believing for that matter that there is a next world Here the fixed idea shades off into religion generally it becomes part of the other worldly orientation of the revealed religions of the world What is the difference between believing in a God you can t see and your dead son whom you can t see What distinguishes one invisibility from another invisibility Nonetheless there is a difference but it is tricky It has to do with the general opinion a slippery area many people believe in God but few people believe that Jeff Archer sticks pins under Kirsten Lundborg s fingernails while she is asleep that is the difference and when put that way the subjectivity of it is plain After all Kirsten and Tim have the goddamn pins and the burned hair and the broken mirrors not to mention the stopped clocks But the two of them are making a logical error for all that Whether the people who believe in God are making an error I don't know since their belief system cannot be tested one way or another It simply is faith Now I had been formally asked to sit in as a hopeful spectator to further phenomena and were they to occur I could along with Tim and Kirsten vouch for what I witnessed and add my name to Tim s forthcoming book a book that his editor had said would undoubtedly outsell all his previous books based on less sensational material But I could not be disinterested Jeff had been my husband I loved him I wanted to believe Worse I sensed the psychological motor driving Kirsten and Tim to believe I did not want to shoot their faith or credulity down because I could see what cynicism would do to them it would leave them with nothing leave them once more with staggering guilt a guilt neither could cope with I found myself then in a position where I had to comply at least pro forma I had to allege belief allege interest allege excitement Neutrality would not be enough enthusiasm was required The damage had been done in England before I was brought in on this The decision was already made If I said It s bullshit they would continue on anyhow but bitterly Fuck the cynicism I thought to myself as I sat with Kirsten that day at the St Francis bar There is nothing to be gained and a lot to lose and anyhow it doesn t matter Tim s book is going to get written and published with or without me That is bad reasoning Just because something bears the aspect of the inevitable one should not therefore go along willingly with it But that was my reasoning I saw this if I told Kirsten and Tim how I felt I could look forward never to seeing either of them again they would cut me off lop me away and discard me and I would have my job at the record shop my friendship with Bishop Archer would be a thing of the past It meant too much to me I could not let it go That was my faulty motivation my wish I wanted to keep on seeing them And so I arranged to collude and knew that I was colluding I decided that day in the St Francis I kept my mouth shut and my opinions to myself and I agreed to log the expected phenomena and so I came to be a part of something that I knew was silly Bishop Archer wrecked his career and not once did I try to talk him out of it After all I had tried to talk him out of his affair with Kirsten to no avail This time he would not merely out argue me he would drop me The cost to me would be too great I did not share their fixed idea But I did as they did and talked as they talked I'm mentioned in Bishop Archer s book he gives me credit for invaluable assistance in noting and recording the day to day manifestations of Jeff of which there were none I guess this is how the world is run by weakness It all goes back to Yeats poem where he speaks of the best lack all conviction or however he phrases it You know the poem I don't have to quote it to you When you shoot at a king you must kill him When you plan to tell a world famous man that he is a fool you must face the fact that you will lose what you cannot bring yourself to lose So I kept my fucking mouth shut drank my drink paid for my drink and Kirsten s accepted the presents she had brought me from London and promised to watch for fast breaking phenomena for all new developments And I would do it again if I had the opportunity because I loved the two of them very much both Kirsten and Tim I loved them far more than I cared about my own probity Friendship loomed large the importance of probity hence probity itself dwindled and at last vanished entirely I said good bye to my integrity and kept my friendships alive Somebody else will have to judge if I did the right thing for I am still not disinterested I still see only two friends just returned from months abroad friends I had longed for especially with Jeff dead friends I could not survive without and deep inside me a subtle factor urged me on a factor I did not admit to that day I took pride in the fact that I knew a man who had marched with Dr King at Selma a famous man whom David Frost interviewed whose opinions helped shape the modem intellectual world There you have it the essence of it I defined myself to myself my identity in terms of being Bishop Archer s daughter in law and friend This is an evil motivation and it pinned me it had me caught fast I know Bishop Timothy Archer my mind uttered to itself in the darkness of the night It whispered these words to me bolstering my self esteem I too felt guilt over Jeff s suicide and by participating in the life and times the customs and habits of Bishop Archer I lost my own self doubts or at least felt them diminish But there is a logical error in my reasoning as well as an ethical one and I had not perceived it through his credulity and superstitious folly the Bishop of California intended to barter away his influence his power to control public opinion the very power that drew me to him Had I been able to timebind adequately that day at the St Francis I would have foreseen this and done differently He would not long be a great man he connived to transform himself from authority to crank Thus much of what drew me to him would soon vanish So in this respect I stood in as deluded a state as he This failed to register on my mind that day I saw him only as he was then not as he would be in a few years I too was operating at a six year old level I did not do any real harm but I did not do any real good and I debased myself really for nothing no good came out of it and when I look back I long bitterly for the insight I have now long to have had it then Bishop Archer swept us along with him because we loved him and believed in him even when we knew he was wrong and this is a terrible realization a matter that should incite moral and spiritual dread It does that in me now but it did not then my dread came too late it came as hindsight This may be tiresome prattle to you but it is something else to me it is my heart s despair THE AUTHORITIES DID NOT keep Bill Lundborg in jail long Bishop Archer arranged for his release based on Bill s history of chronic mental illness and presently a day came when the boy showed up at their apartment in the Tenderloin wearing a wool sweater Kirsten had knitted for him and his baggy pants his pudgy face bland It personally gladdened me to see him I had thought about him a number of times wondering how he was doing Jail did not seem to have done him any harm Perhaps he did not distinguish it from his periodic confinements in the hospital For all I knew not that much difference existed I had been confined in neither Hi Angel he said to me as I entered the apartment I had been forced to move my new Honda to keep from getting a ticket What is that you're driving A Honda Civic I said That s a good engine in that Bill said It doesn t over rev like most mills that small And it s sprung well Do you have the four speed or the five Four I took off my coat and hung it in the hall closet For that short a wheel base it rides really good Bill said But on impact if an American car hits you you d be wiped out You d probably roll He told me then the statistics on fatalities in single car accidents It presented a gloomy picture insofar as small foreign cars were concerned My chances were nothing like say with a Mustang Bill spoke with enthusiasm about the new front wheel drive Oldsmobile which he depicted as a major engineering advance in terms of traction and road handling It was evident that he believed I should get a larger car he exhibited concern for my safety I found this touching and moreover he knew what he was talking about I had lost two friends to a single car accident involving a VW Beetle the rear wheels of which had cambered in causing the car to roll Bill explained that that design had been successfully modified starting in after that VW utilized a fixed rather than swing axle It limited toe in I think I have these terms right I am dependent on Bill for this kind of information about cars Kirsten listened with apathy Bishop Archer revealed at least simulated attention although I had the impression that this was a pose It seemed impossible to me that he either cared or understood for the bishop such matters as toe in were as metaphysical matters are to the rest of us mere speculation and a frivolous one at that When Bill disappeared into the kitchen for a can of Coors Kirsten s lips formed into a word directed at me What I said cupping my ear Obsession She nodded solemnly and with distaste Returning with the beer Bill said Your life depends on the suspension of your car A transversal torsion bar suspension provides If I hear anything more about cars Kirsten interrupted I am going to begin shrieking Sorry Bill said Bill Bishop Archer said if I were to buy a new car what car should I get How much money I have the money the bishop said A BMW Bill said Or a Mercedes Benz One advantage with a Mercedes Benz is that nobody can steal it He explained then about the astoundingly sophisticated locks on the Mercedes Benz Even car repossessors have trouble getting into them he finished A thief can rip off six Caddies and three Porsches in the time it takes to get into a Mercedes Benz So they tend to leave them alone that way you can leave your stereo in the car Otherwise with any other car you have to lug it around with you He told us then that it had been Carl Benz who had engineered and built the first practical automobile propelled by an internal combustion engine In Benz had merged his company with Daimler Motoren Gesellschaft to form Daimler Benz from which had come the Mercedes Benz cars The name Mercedes was that of a little girl whom Carl Benz had known but Bill could not remember if Mercedes had been Benz s daughter grandchild or what So Mercedes was not the name of an auto designer or engineer Tim said but rather the name of a child And now that child s name is associated with some of the finest automobiles in the world That s true Bill said He told us another story about automobiles that few people knew Dr Porsche who had designed both the VW and of course the Porsche had not invented the rear engine air cooled design he had encountered it in Czechoslovakia in an auto firm there when the Germans took over that country in Bill could not remember the name of the Czech car but it had been eight cylinder not four a high powered very fast car that rolled so readily that German officers were finally forbidden to drive them Dr Porsche had modified the eight cylinder high performance design at Hitler s personal order Hitler wanted an air cooled engine utilized Bill said because he expected to use the VWs on autobahns in the Soviet Union after Germany took it over and because of the weather because of the cold I think you should get a Jaguar Kirsten interrupted speaking to Tim Oh no Bill said The Jaguar is one of the most unstable trouble prone cars in the world it s far too complex and requires you to have it in the shop all the time However their terrific double overhead cam engine is maybe the finest high performance mill ever built excepting the sixteen cylinder touring cars of the Thirties Sixteen cylinders I said amazed They were very smooth Bill said There was a huge gap between the flivvers of the Thirties and the expensive touring cars we don't have that gap now there is a complete spread from say your Honda Civic which is basic transportation up to the Rolls Price and quality go in small increments now which is a good thing It s a measure of the change in society between then and now He started to tell us about steam cars and why that design had failed Kirsten however rose to her feet and glared at him severely I think I ll go to bed Kirsten said Tim said to her What time am I speaking at the Lions Club tomorrow Oh God I don't have that speech finished Kirsten said I can improvise Tim said It s on the tape All I have to do is transcribe it You can do that in the morning She stared at him As I say Tim said I can improvise To Bill and me Kirsten said He can improvise She continued to stare at the bishop who shifted about uncomfortably Christ she said What s wrong Tim said Nothing She walked toward the bedroom I ll finish transcribing it It wouldn t be a good idea if you I don't know why we have to keep going into this Promise me you won t launch into one of your tirades about the Zoroastrians Faintly but firmly Tim said If I'm to trace the origins of Patristic thought I don't think the Lions want to hear about the desert fathers and the monastic life in the second century Then that is exactly what I should talk about Tim said To Bill and me he said A monk was dispatched to a city carrying with him medicine for an ailing saint the names are not necessary What must be understood is that the ailing saint was a very great saint one of the most beloved and revered in the north of Africa When the monk reached the city after a long journey across the desert he Good night Kirsten said and disappeared into the bedroom Good night we all said After a pause Tim continued speaking in a low voice to Bill and me When he entered the city the monk did not know where to go Stumbling about in the darkness it was night he came across a beggar lying in the gutter quite ill The monk after pondering the spiritual aspects of the issue ministered to the beggar applying the medication to him with the result that the beggar soon showed signs of mending However now the monk had nothing to take to the great ailing saint He therefore returned to the monastery from which he had come dreadfully afraid of what his abbot would say When he had told the abbot what he had done the abbot said You did the right thing Tim fell silent then The three of us sat none of us speaking Is that it Bill said Tim said In Christianity no distinction is made between the humble and the great the poor and the not so poor The monk by giving the medication to the first sick man he saw instead of saving it for the great and famous saint had seen into the heart of his Savior There was a term of contempt used in Jesus time for the ordinary people they were dismissed as the Am ha aretz a Hebrew term meaning simply the people of the land meaning that they had no importance It was to these people the Am ha aretz that Jesus spoke and with whom he mingled ate and slept that is slept in their houses although he did sleep occasionally in the houses of the rich for even the rich are not excluded Tim seemed somewhat downcast I noticed The bish Bill said smiling That s what Kirsten calls you behind your back Tim said nothing to that We could hear Kirsten moving about in the other room something fell and she cursed What makes you think there s a God Bill said to Tim For a time Tim said nothing He seemed quite tired and yet I sensed him trying to summon a response Wearily he rubbed his eyes There is the ontological proof he murmured St Anselm s ontological argument that if a Being can be imagined He broke off lifted his head blinked I can type up your speech I said to him That was my job at the law office I'm good at that I rose I ll go tell Kirsten There is no problem Tim said Wouldn t it be better if you were speaking from a written transcript I said Tim said I want to tell them about the He ceased speaking You know Angel he said to me I really love her She has done so much for me And if she hadn t been with me after Jeff s death I don't know what I would have done I'm sure you understand To Bill he said I am terribly fond of your mother She is the person closest to me in all the world Is there any proof of God s existence Bill said After a pause Tim said A number of arguments are given Perhaps the best is the argument from biology advanced for instance by Teilhard de Chardin Evolution the existence of evolution seems to point to a designer Also there is Morrison s argument that our planet shows a remarkable hospitality toward complex forms of life The chance of this happening on a random basis is very small I'm sorry He shook his head I'm not feeling well We ll discuss it some other time I would say however in brief that the teleological argument the argument from design in nature from purpose in nature is the strongest argument Bill I said the bishop is tired Opening the bedroom door Kirsten who now had on her robe and slippers said The bishop is tired The bishop is always tired The bishop is too tired to answer the question Is there any proof of the existence of God No there is no proof Where is the Alka Seltzer I took the last packet Tim said remotely I have some in my purse I said Kirsten closed the bedroom door Loudly There are proofs Tim said But God doesn t talk to anybody Bill said No Tim said He rallied then I saw him draw himself up However the Old Testament gives us many instances of Yahweh addressing his people through the prophets This fountain of revelation dried up finally God no longer speaks to man It is called the long silence It has lasted two thousand years I realize God talked to people in the Bible Bill said in the olden days but why doesn t he talk to them now Why did he stop I don't know Tim said He said no more there he ceased I thought You should not stop there That is not the place to come to the end Please go on I said What time is it Tim said he looked around the living room I don't have my watch Bill said What s this nonsense about Jeff coming back from the next world Oh God I said to myself I shut my eyes I really wish you would explain it to me Bill said to Tim Because it s impossible It s not just unlikely it s impossible He waited Kirsten has been telling me about it he said It s the stupidest thing I ever heard of Jeff has communicated with the two of us Tim said Through intermediary phenomena Many times in many ways All at once he reddened he drew himself up and the authority that lay deep in him rose to the surface he changed as he sat there from a tired middle aged man with personal problems into force itself the force of conviction contrived into formed into words It is God Himself working on us and through us to bring forth a brighter day My son is with us now he is with us in this room He never left us What died was a material body Every material thing perishes Whole planets perish The physical universe itself will perish Are you going to argue then that nothing exists Because that is where your logic will carry you It isn t possible right now to prove that external reality exists Descartes discovered that it s the basis of modern philosophy All you can know for sure is that your own mind your own consciousness exists You can say I am and that s all And that is what Yahweh tells Moses to say when the people ask who he has talked to I am Yahweh says Ehyeh in Hebrew You also can say that and that is all you can say that exhausts it What you see is not world but a representation formed in and by your own mind Everything that you experience you know by faith Also you may be dreaming Had you thought of that Plato relates that a wise old man probably an Orphic said to him Now we are dead and in a kind of prison Plato did not consider that an absurd statement he tells us that it is weighty and something to think about Now we are dead We may have no world at all I have enough evidence your mother and I for Jeff returning to us as I have that the world itself exists We do not suppose he has come back we experience him as coming back We have lived and are living through it So it is not our opinion It is real Real for you Bill said What more can reality give Well I mean Bill said I don't believe it The problem does not lie with our experience in this matter Tim said It lies with your belief system Within the confines of your belief system such a thing is impossible Who can say truly say what is possible We have no knowledge of what is and isn t possible we do not set the limits God sets the limits Tim pointed at Bill his finger was steady What one believes and what one knows depend in the final analysis on God you can t will your own consent or refusal to consent it is a gift from God an instance of our dependence God grants us a world and compels our assent to that world he makes it real for us this is one of his powers Do you believe that Jesus was the Son of God was God Himself You don't believe that either So how can I prove to you that Jeff returned to us from the other world I can t even demonstrate that the Son of Man walked this Earth two thousand years ago for us and lived for us and died for us for our sins and rose in glory on the third day Am I not right about that Do you not deny that also What do you believe then In objects you get into and drive around the block There may be no objects and no block someone pointed out to Descartes that a malicious demon may cause our assent to a world that is not there may impress a forgery onto us as an ostensible representation of the world If that happened we would not know We must trust we must trust God I trust in God that he would not deceive me I deem the Lord faithful and true and incapable of deceit For you that question does not even exist for you will not grant that He exists in the first place You ask for proof If I told you this minute that I have heard God s voice speaking to me would you believe that Of course not We call people who speak to God pious and we call people to whom God speaks lunatics This is an age where there is little faith It is not God who is dead it is our faith that has died But Bill gestured It doesn t make any sense Why would he come back Tell me why Jeff lived in the first place Tim said Then perhaps I can tell you why he came back Why do you live For what purpose were you created You do not know who created you assuming anyone did and you do not know why assuming there is a why Perhaps no one created you and perhaps there is no purpose to your life No world no purpose no Creator and Jeff has not come back to us Is that your logic Is that how you live out your life Is that what Being in Heidegger s sense is to you That is an impoverished kind of inauthentic Being It strikes me as weak and barren and in the end futile There must be something you can believe Bill Do you believe in yourself Will you grant that you Bill Lundborg exist You will grant that fine Good enough We have a start Examine your body Do you have sense organs Eyes ears taste touch and smell Then probably this percept system was designed to receive information If that is so it is reasonable to assume that information exists If information exists it probably pertains to something Probably there is a world not certainly but probably and you are linked to that world through your sense organs Do you create your own food Do you out of yourself out of your own body generate the food that you need in order to live You do not Therefore it is logical to assume that you are dependent on this outer world of whose existence you possess only probable knowledge not necessary knowledge world is for us only a contingent truth not an ineluctable one What does this world consist of What is out there Do your senses lie If they lie why were they caused to come into being Did you create your own sense organs No you did not Someone or something else did Who is that someone who is not you Apparently you are not alone the sole existent reality apparently there are others and one of them or several of them designed and built you and your body the way Carl Benz designed and built the first motorcar How do I know there was a Carl Benz Because you told me I told you about my son Jeff returning Kirsten told me Bill corrected him Does Kirsten normally lie to you Tim said No Bill said What do she and I gain by saying that Jeff has returned to us from the other world Many people will not believe us You yourself do not believe us We say it because we believe it is true And we have reasons to believe it is true We have both seen things witnessed things I don't see Carl Benz in this room but I believe he once existed I believe that the Mercedes Benz is named after a little girl and a man I am a lawyer I am a person familiar with the criteria by which data is scrutinized We Kirsten and I have the evidence of Jeff the phenomena Yeah but that phenomena you have all of them they don't prove anything you're just assuming Jeff caused it caused those things You don't know Tim said Let me give you an example You look under your parked car and you find a pool of water Now you don't know that the water came from your motor that is something you have to assume You have evidence As an attorney I understand what constitutes evidence You as an automechanic Is the car parked in your own parking slot Bill said Or is it in a public parking lot like at the supermarket Slightly taken aback Tim paused I don't follow you If it s your own garage or parking slot Bill said where only you park then it s probably from your car Anyhow it wouldn t be from the motor it d be from the radiator or the water pump or one of the hoses But this is something you assume Tim said Based on the evidence It could be power steering fluid That looks a lot like water It s sort of pinkish Also your transmission if you have an auto matic transmission uses the same kind of fluid Do you have power steering On what Tim said On your car I don't know I'm speaking about a hypothetical car Or it could be engine oil Bill said in which case it wouldn t be pink You have to distinguish whether it s water or whether it s oil if it s from the power steering or the transmission it could be several things If you're in a public place and you see a puddle under your car it probably doesn t mean anything because a lot of people park where you're parked it could have come from the car parked there before you The best thing to do is But you're only able to make an assumption Tim said You can t know it came from your car You can t know right away but you can find out Okay let s say it s your own garage and no one else parks there The first thing to figure out is what kind of fluid it is So you reach under the car you may have to back it out first and dip your finger in the fluid Now is it pink Or brown Is it oil Is it water Let s say it s water Well it could be normal it could be overflow from the relief system of your radiator after you turn off an engine the water gets hotter sometimes and blows out through the relief pipe Even if you can determine that it is water Tim said doggedly you can t be sure it came from your car Where else would it come from That s an unknown factor you're acting on indirect evidence you didn t see the water come from your car Okay turn the engine on let it run and watch See if it drips Wouldn t that take a long time Tim said Well you have to know You should check the level in the power steering system you should check your transmission level your radiator your motor oil you should routinely check all those things While you're standing there you can check them Some of them like the level of fluid in the transmission have to be checked while the motor s running Meanwhile you can also check your tire pressure What pressure do you carry In what Tim said Your tires Bill smiled There re five of them One in your trunk your spare You probably forget to check that when you check the others You won t find out you ve got no air in your spare until you get a blowout someday and then you ll find out if you have air in your spare Do you have a bumper jack or an axle jack What kind of car are you driving I think it s a Buick Tim said It s a Chrysler I said quietly Oh Tim said After Bill departed for his trip back to the East Bay Tim and I sat together in the living room of the Tenderloin apartment and Tim talked openly and candidly to me Kirsten and I he said have been having a few difficulties He sat beside me on the couch speaking in a low voice so that Kirsten in the bedroom would not hear How many downers is she taking I said You mean barbiturates Yes I mean barbiturates I said I really don't know She has a doctor who gives her all she wants she gets a hundred at one time Seconal And also she has Amytal I think the Amytal is from a different doctor You better find out how many she s taking Tim said Why would Bill resist the realization that Jeff has come back to us Lord only knows I said The purpose of my book is to provide comfort to heartbroken people who have lost loved ones What could be more reassuring than the knowledge that there is a life beyond the trauma of death just as there is life beyond the trauma of birth We are assured by Jesus that an afterlife awaits us on this the whole promise of salvation depends I am the Resurrection If anyone believes in me even though he dies he will live and whoever lives and believes in me will never die And then Jesus says to Martha Do you believe in this to which Martha responds Yes Lord I believe that you are the Christ the Son of God the one who was to come into this world Later Jesus says For what I have spoken does not come from myself no what I was to say what I had to speak was commanded by the Father who sent me and I know that his commands mean eternal life Let me get my Bible Tim reached for a copy of the Bible which lay on the end table First Corinthians fifteen twelve Now if Christ raised from the dead is what has been preached how can some of you be saying that there is no resurrection of the dead If there is no resurrection of the dead Christ himself cannot have been raised and if Christ has not been raised then our preaching is useless and your believing it is useless indeed we are shown up as witnesses who have committed perjury before God because we swore in evidence before God that he had raised Christ to life For if the dead are not raised Christ has not been raised and if Christ has not been raised you are still in your sins And what is more serious all who have died in Christ have perished If our hope in Christ has been for this life only we are the most unfortunate of all people But Christ has in fact been raised from the dead the first fruits of all who have fallen asleep Tim closed his Bible That says it clearly and plainly There can be no doubt whatsoever Guess so I said So much evidence turned up at the Zadokite Wadi So much that sheds light on the whole kerygma of early Christianity We know so much now In no way was Paul speaking metaphorically man literally rises from the dead They had the techniques It was a science We would call it medicine today They had the anokhi there at the wadi The mushroom I said He eyed me Yes the anokhi mushroom Bread and broth I said Yes But we don't have it now We have the Eucharist I said But you know and I know that the substance is not there in the Eucharist It s like the cargo cults where the natives build fake airplanes Not at all How is it different The Holy Spirit He broke off That s what I mean I said Tim said I feel that the Holy Spirit is responsible for Jeff coming back So then you reason that the Holy Spirit does still exist and always existed and is God one of the forms of God I do now Tim said Now that I ve seen evidence I did not believe it until I saw the evidence the clocks set at the time of Jeff s death Kirsten s burned hair the broken mirrors the pins stuck under her fingernails You saw her clothes all disarranged that time we had you come in and see for yourself We didn t do that No living person did that we wouldn t manufacture evidence Do you believe we would do that contrive a fraud No I said And the day that those books leaped out of the bookshelf and fell to the floor no one was there You saw that with your own eyes Do you think the anokhi mushroom still exists I asked I don't know There is a vita verna mushroom mentioned it in Pliny the Elder s Historia Naturalis Book Eight He lived in the first century it would be about the right time And this citation was not something he derived from Theophrastus this was a mushroom he saw himself from his direct knowledge of Roman gardens It may be the anokhi But that s only a guess I wish we could be sure He changed the subject then as was his custom Tim Archer s mind never stayed on one topic for long It s schizophrenia that Bill has isn t it Yep I said But he can earn a living When he s not in the hospital I said Or spiraling into himself and on the way to the hospital He seems to be doing fine right now But I note an inability to theorize He has trouble abstracting I said I wonder where and how he ll wind up Tim said The prognosis it s not good Kirsten says It s zero For recovery Zilch Zip But he s smart enough to stay off drugs He does not have the advantage of an education I'm not sure an education is an advantage All I do is work in a record store And I wasn t hired for that because of anything I learned in the English Department at Cal I ve been meaning to ask you which recording of Beethoven s Fidelio we should buy Tim said The Klemperer I said On Angel With Christa Ludwig as Leonora I am very fond of her aria Tim said Abscheulicher Wo Eilst Due Hin She does it very well But no one can match Frieda Leider s recording years ago It s a collectors item it may have been dubbed onto an LP if so I ve never seen it I heard it once over KPFA years ago I never forgot it Tim said Beethoven was the greatest genius the greatest creative artist the world has ever seen He transformed man s conception of himself Yes I said The prisoners in Fidelio when they re let out into the light it is one of the most beautiful passages in all music It goes beyond beauty Tim said It involves an apprehension of the nature of freedom itself How can it be that purely abstract music such as his late quartets can without words change human beings in terms of their own awareness of themselves in terms of their ontological nature Schopenhauer believed that art in particular music had has the power to cause the will the irrational striving will to somehow turn back onto and into itself and cease to strive He considered this a religious experience although temporary Somehow art somehow music especially has the power to transform man from an irrational thing into some rational entity that is not driven by biological impulses impulses that cannot by definition ever be satisfied I remember when I first heard the final movement of the Beethoven Thirteenth Quartet not the Grosse Fuge but the allegro that he added later in place of the Grosse Fuge It s such an odd little bit that allegro so brisk and light so sunny I said I ve read that it was the last thing he wrote That little allegro would have been the first work of Beethoven s fourth period had he lived It s not really a third period piece Where did Beethoven derive the concept the entirely new and original concept of human freedom that his music expresses Tim asked Was he well read He belonged to the period of Goethe and Schiller The Aufklärung the German Enlightenment Always Schiller It always comes back to that And from Schiller to the rebellion of the Dutch against the Spanish the War of the Lowlands Which shows up in Goethe s Faust Part Two where Faust finally finds something that will satisfy him and he bids the moment stay Seeing the Dutch reclaiming land from the North Sea I translated that passage once myself I wasn t satisfied with any of the English translations available I don't know what I did with it that was years ago Do you know the Bayard Taylor translation He rose approached a row of books found the volume brought it back opening it as he walked Below the hills a marshy plain infects what I so long have been retrieving that stagnant pool likewise to drain were now my latest and my best achieving To many millions let me furnish soil though not secure let free for active toil green fertile fields where men and herds go forth at once with comfort on the newest earth all swiftly settled on the hill s firm base raised by a bold hard working populace In here a land like Paradise about up to the brink the tide may roar without yet though it gnaw to burst with force the limit by common impulse all men seek to hem it Yes to this thought I hold with firm persistence this wisdom s ultimate and true he only earns his freedom and existence I said Who daily conquers them anew Yes Tim said he closed the copy of Faust Part Two I wish I hadn t lost the translation I made He then opened the book again Do you mind if I read the rest Please do I said Thus here by dangers girt shall glide away of childhood manhood age and vigorous day And such a throng I fain would see stand on free soil among a people free Then dared I hail the Moment fleeting Ah finger still thou art so fair At that point God has won the bet in heaven I said Yes Tim said nodding The traces cannot of mine earthly being in aeons perish they are there Anticipating here such lofty bliss I now enjoy the highest Moment this That s a very beautiful and clear translation I said Tim said Goethe wrote Part Two just a year before his death I remember only one German word from that passage verdienen Earns Earns his freedom I suppose that would be Freiheit freedom Perhaps it went Verdient seine Freiheit He broke off That s the best I can do Earns his freedom who daily conquers it them freedom and existence anew The highest point in German Enlightenment From which they so tragically fell From Goethe Schiller Beethoven to the Third Reich and Hitler It seems impossible And yet it had been prefigured in Wallenstein I said Who picked his generals by means of astrological prognostications How could an intelligent educated man a great man really one of the most powerful men of his times how could he begin to believe in that Bishop Archer said It is a mystery to me It is an enigma that perhaps will never be solved I saw how tired he was so I got my coat and purse said good night and departed My car had been ticketed Shit I said to myself as I pulled the ticket from the wiper blade and stuck it into my pocket While we re reading Goethe Lovely Rita Meter Maid is ticketing my car What a strange world I thought or rather strange worlds plural They do not come together BISHOP TIMOTHY ARCHER conceived in his mind after much prayer and pondering after much application of his brilliant analytical faculties the notion that he had no choice but to step down as Bishop of the Episcopal Diocese of California and go as he phrased it into the private sector He discussed this matter with Kirsten and me at length I have no faith in the reality of Christ he informed us None whatsoever I cannot in good conscience go on preaching the kerygma of the New Testament Every time I get up in front of my congregation I feel that I am deceiving them You told Bill Lundborg that night that Christ s reality is proven by Jeff coming back I said It s not Tim said It fails to I have exhaustively scrutinized the situation and it fails to What does it prove then Kirsten said Life after death Tim said But not the reality of Christ Jesus was a teacher whose teachings were not even original I have the name of a medium a Dr Garret living in Santa Barbara I will be flying down there to consult him to try to talk to Jeff Mr Mason recommends him He examined a slip of paper Oh he said Dr Garret is a woman Rachel Garret Hmmm I was certain it was a man He asked if the two of us wished to accompany him to Santa Barbara It was his intention he explained to ask Jeff about Christ Jeff could tell him through the medium Dr Rachel Garret if Christ were real or not genuinely the Son of God and all the rest of that stuff that the churches teach This would be an important trip Tim s decision as to whether to resign his post as bishop hinged on this Moreover Tim s faith was involved He had spent decades rising within the Episcopal Church but now he seriously doubted whether Christianity was valid That was Tim s term valid It struck me as a weak and trendy term falling tragically short of the magnitude of the forces contending within Tim s heart and mind However it was the term he used he spoke in a calm manner devoid of any hysterical overtones It was as if he were planning whether or not to buy a suit of clothes Christ he said is a role not a person It the word is a mistransliteration from the Hebrew Messiah which literally means the Anointed One which is to say the Chosen One The Messiah of course comes at the end of the world and ushers in the Age of Gold which replaces the Age of Iron the age we now live in This finds its most beautiful expression in the Fourth Eclogue of Virgil Let me see I have it here He went to his books as he always did in time of gravity We don't need to hear Virgil Kirsten said in a biting tone Here it is Tim said oblivious to her Ultima Cumaei venit iam carminis aetas magnus That s enough Kirsten said sharply He glanced at her puzzled Kirsten said I think it s insanely foolish and selfish of you to resign as bishop Let me translate the eclogue for you at least Tim said Then you ll understand better I understand that you're destroying your life and mine Kirsten said What about me He shook his head I ll be hired on at the Foundation for Free Institutions What the hell is that Kirsten said It s a think tank I said In Santa Barbara Then you're going to be talking with them while you're down there Kirsten said Yes He nodded I have an appointment with Pomeroy who s in charge of it Felton Pomeroy I d be their Consultant in Theological Matters They re very highly thought of I said Kirsten gave me a look that would have withered trees There s been nothing decided Tim said We are going to see Rachel Garret anyhow I see no reason why I shouldn t combine the two in a single trip That way I ll have to fly down there only once I'm supposed to set up your appointments Kirsten said Actually Tim said this will be a purely informal discussion We ll have lunch I ll meet the other consultants I ll see their buildings and gardens They have very lovely gardens I saw the Foundation s gardens several years ago and still remember them To me he said You ll love them Angel Every kind of rose is represented especially Peace All the five star patented roses are there or however it is roses are rated May I read the two of you the translation of Virgil s eclogue Now comes the final age announced in the Cumaen Sibyl s chant the great succession of epochs is born anew Now the Virgin returns the reign of Saturn returns now a new race descends from heaven on high O chaste Lucina goddess of births smile upon the boy just born in whose time the race of iron shall first cease and a race of gold shall arise throughout the world Thine own Apollo is now king Kirsten and I looked at each other I saw Kirsten s lips move but I heard no sound Heaven only knows what she was saying and thinking at that moment as she witnessed Tim shoot down his career and life out of conviction more properly lack of conviction faith in the Savior The problem for Kirsten was simply that she could not see the problem To her Tim s dilemma was a phantom dilemma manufactured for bookish reasons According to her reasoning he had the option to shed the problem any time he saw fit her analysis was simply that Tim had become restive in his job as bishop and wanted to move on asserting a loss of faith in Christ was his way of justifying his career move Since it was a stupid career move she did not approve After all she gained so very much from his status as she had said Tim was not thinking about her he thought only of himself Dr Garret is highly recommended Tim said almost in a plaintive voice as if appealing to one or the other of us for support Tim I said I really think You think with your crotch Kirsten said What I said You heard me I know about your little conversations that you two have after I go to bed When you're alone And I know you ve been meeting Meeting what I said Each other Christ I said Christ Kirsten echoed Always Christ Always the summoning of the Almighty Son of God to justify your selfishness and what you're up to I find it disgusting I find both of you disgusting To Tim she said I know you visited her goddamn record store last week To buy an album Tim said Of Fidelio You could have gotten it here in the City Kirsten said Or I could have picked it up for you Tim said I wanted to see what she had She doesn t have anything I don't have Kirsten said The Missa Solemnis Tim said faintly he seemed dazed appealing to me he said Can you reason with her I can reason with myself Kirsten said I can reason out exactly what s going on You better knock off taking those downers Kirsten I said And you better stop turning on five times a day Her look carried such furious hate that I could not credit my senses You smoke enough grass to She broke off More than the San Francisco Police Department uses in a month I'm sorry I'm not feeling well Excuse me She walked into the bedroom the door shut silently after her We could hear her stirring around Then we heard her go into the bathroom water ran she was taking a pill probably a barbiturate To Tim who stood inert and amazed I said Barbiturates cause that kind of personality change It s the pills talking not her I think He rallied I really want to fly down to Santa Barbara and see Dr Garret Do you think it s the fact that she s a woman Kirsten I said Or Garret Garret I could swear it was a man I just now noticed the first name I may have gotten it wrong Maybe that s what s upsetting her She ll calm down We ll go together Dr Mason said that Dr Garret is elderly and infirm and semiretired so she won t pose any threat to Kirsten once she sees her To change the subject I said Did you play the Missa Solemnis that I sold you No Tim said vaguely I haven t had time It s not the best recording I said Columbia uses a peculiar microphone placement they have microphones scattered around throughout the orchestra with the idea of bringing out the individual instruments The idea is good but it does away with hall ambiance It bothers her that I'm stepping down Tim said As bishop You should think about it longer I said Before you do it Are you sure it s this medium that you want to consult Isn t there someone in the church you go to when you have a spiritual crisis I will be consulting Jeff The medium acts as a passive agent much in the fashion that a telephone acts He went on then to explain how misunderstood mediums are I half listened neither impressed nor caring Kirsten s hostility had upset me even though I had become used to it this amounted to more than her chronic bitchiness I can tell a red freak when I see one I said to myself The personality change the hair trigger response The paranoia She is crapping out on us I said to myself She is going down the drain Worse she is not going down the drain alone her nails are dug deep in us and we go perforce along Shit This is just dreadful a man like Tim Archer should not have to put up with this I should not have to Kirsten opened the bedroom door Come in here she said to Tim I will in a minute Tim said You will come in here now I said I ll take off No Tim said you will not take off I have further things to discuss with you Is it your contention that I should not step down as bishop When my book comes out about Jeff I will have to step down The church will not allow me to publish a controversial book of that sort It is too radical for them put another way they are too reactionary for it It is ahead of its time and they are behind the times There is no difference between my stand on this issue and my stand on the Vietnam War I bucked the Establishment on that and I should theoretically be able to buck the Establishment on the issue of life beyond the grave but with the war I have support from the youth of America But in this matter I have support from no one Kirsten said You have my support but that doesn t matter to you I mean public support The support of those in power those who control human minds unfortunately My support means nothing to you Kirsten repeated It means everything to me Tim said I could not I would not have dared to write the book without you I would not even have believed without you It is you who gives me my strength My capacity to understand And from Jeff when we have contacted him I will learn about Jesus Christ one way or another I will learn if the Zadokite Documents do in fact indicate that Jesus spoke only secondhand of what he had been taught or possibly Jeff will tell me that Christ is with him or he with Christ in the other world the upper realm where we all go eventually where he is now reaching across to us as best he can God bless him I said You see this business with Jeff then as a sort of opportunity To clear up your doubts one way or another about the meaning of the Zadokite I think I have made that clear Tim interrupted peevishly That is why it is so crucial To talk to him How strange I thought To use his son make calculated use of his dead son to determine an historical issue But it is more than an historical issue it is Tim Archer s entire corpus of faith the summation for him of belief itself Belief or the falling away of belief What is at stake here is belief versus nihilism for Tim to lose Christ is for Tim to lose everything And he has lost Christ his statements to Bill that night may have been Tim s last defense of the fortress before that fortress fell It may have fallen then or perhaps before then Tim argued from memory as if from a page A written speech spread out before him as when in the celebration of the Last Supper he reads from the Book of Common Prayer The son his son my husband subordinated to an intellectual matter I could never myself view it that way This amounts to a depersonalization of Jeff Archer he is converted into an instrument a device for learning why he is converted into a talking book Like all these books that Tim forever reaches for especially in moments of crisis Everything worth knowing can be found in a book conversely if Jeff is important he is important not as a person but as a book it is books for books sakes then not knowledge even for the sake of knowledge The book is the reality For Tim to love and appreciate his son he must as impossible as this may seem he must regard him as a kind of book The universe to Tim Archer is one great set of reference books from which he picks and chooses as his restless mind veers on always seeking the new always turning away from the old it is the very opposite of that passage from Faust that he read Tim has not found the moment where he says Stay it is still fleeing from him still in motion And I am not much different I realized I who graduated from the English Department at U C Berkeley Tim and I are of a kind Has it not been the final canto of Dante s Commedia that struck off my identity when I first read it that day when I was in school Canto Thirty three of Paradiso for me the culmination where Dante says I beheld leaves within the unfathomed blaze Into one volume bound by love the same That the universe holds scattered through its maze Substance and accidents and their modes became As if fused together all in such wise That what I speak of is one simple flame The superb Laurence Binyon translation and then C H Grandgent comments on this passage God is the Book of the Universe To which another commentator I forget which one said This is a Platonist notion Platonist or otherwise this is the sequences of words that framed me that made me what I am this is my source this vision and report this view of final things I do not call myself a Christian but I cannot forget this view this wonder I remember the night I read that final canto of Paradiso read it truly read it for the first time I had that infected tooth and I hurt hideously unbearably so I sat up all night drinking bourbon straight and reading Dante and at nine A M the next day I drove to the dentist s without phoning without an appointment showed up with tears dripping down my face demanding that Dr Davidson do something for me which he did So that final canto is deeply impressed onto and into me it is associated with terrible pain and pain that went on for hours into the night so there was no one to talk to and out of that I came to fathom the ultimate things in my own way not a formal or official way but a way nonetheless He who learns must suffer And even in our sleep pain that cannot forget falls drop by drop upon the heart and in our own despair against our will comes wisdom to us by the awful grace of God Or however it goes Aeschylus I forget now One of the three of them who wrote the tragedies Which means that I can say with all truthfulness that for me the moment of greatest understanding in which I knew spiritual reality at last came in connection with emergency root canal irrigation two hours in the dentist chair And twelve hours drinking bourbon bad bourbon at that and simply reading Dante without listening to the stereo or eating there was no way I could eat and suffering and it was all worth it I will never forget it I am no different then from Timothy Archer To me too books are real and alive the voices of human beings issue forth from them and compel my assent the way God compels our assent to world as Tim said When you have been in that much distress you are not going to forget what you did and saw and thought and read that night I did nothing saw nothing thought nothing I read and I remember I did not read Howard the Duck or The Fabulous Furry Freak Brothers or Snatch Comix that night I read Dante s Commedia from Inferno through Purgatorio until at last I arrived in the three colored rings of light and the time was nine A M and I could get into my fucking car and shoot out into traffic and Dr Davidson s office crying and cursing the whole way with no breakfast not even coffee and stinking of sweat and bourbon a sorry mess indeed much gaped at by the dentist s receptionist So for me in a certain unusual way for certain unusual reasons books and reality are fused they join through one incident one night of my life my intellectual life and my practical life came together nothing is more real than a badly infected tooth and having done so they never completely came apart again If I believed in God I would say that he showed me something that night he showed me the totality pain physical pain drop by drop and then this being his dreadful grace there came understanding and what did I understand That it is all real the abscessed tooth and the root canal irrigation and no less and no more Three circles from its substance now appeared Of three colors and each an equal whole That was Dante s vision of God as the Trinity Most people when they try to read the Commedia get bogged down in Inferno and suppose his vision to be that of a chamber of horrors people head up in shit people head down in shit and a lake of ice suggesting Arabic influences that is the Muslim hell but this is only the beginning of the journey it is how it starts I read the Commedia through to the end that night and then shot up the street for Dr Davidson s office and was never the same again I never changed back into what I had previously been So books are real to me too they link me not just with other minds but with the vision of other minds what those minds understand and see I see their worlds as well as I see my own The pain and the crying and the sweating and stinking and cheap Jim Beam Bourbon was my Inferno and it wasn t imaginary what I read bore the label Paradiso and Paradiso it was This is the triumph of Dante s vision that all the realms are real none less than the others none more than the others And they blend into each other by means of what Bill would call gradual increments which is indeed the proper term There is a harmony in this because like automobiles of today in contrast to autos of the Thirties no sharp break exists God save me from another night like that But goddamn it had I not lived out that night drinking and crying and reading and hurting I would never have been born truly born That was the time of my birth into the real world and the real world for me is a mixture of pain and beauty and this is the correct view of it because these are the components that make up reality And I had them all there that night including a packet of pain pills to carry home with me from the dentist s after my ordeal had ended I arrived home took a pill drank some coffee and went to bed And yet I feel that this was what Tim had not done he had either not integrated the book and the pain or if he had he had got it wrong He had the tune but not the words More correctly he had the words but those words pertained not to world but to other words which is termed by philosophy books and articles on logic a vicious regress It is sometimes said in such books and articles that again a regress threatens which means that the thinker has entered a loop and is in great danger Usually he does not know it A critical commentator with a mind that is keen and an eye that is keen comes along and points this out Or doesn t For Tim Archer I could not serve as that critical commentator Who could Dingaling Bill had taken a good shot at it and had been sent back to his East Bay apartment to think better of it Jeff has the answers to my questions Tim said Yes I should have said but Jeff does not exist And very likely the questions themselves are irreal as well That left only Tim And he was busily preparing his book dealing with Jeff s return from the next world the book that Tim knew would finish off his career in the Episcopal Church and moreover deal him out of the game of influencing public opinion That is a high price to pay that is a very vicious regress And indeed it threatened It was in fact at hand the time for the trip to Santa Barbara to visit Dr Rachel Garret the medium had come Santa Barbara California strikes me as one of the most touchingly beautiful places in the country Although technically which is to say geographically it is a portion of Southern California spiritually it is not either that or else we in the north supremely misunderstand the Southland A few years ago antiwar students from the University of California at Santa Barbara burned down the Bank of America to everyone s secret delight the town then is not cut off from time and world not isolated although its lovely gardens suggest a tame persuasion rather than a violent one The three of us flew from the San Francisco International Airport to the small airport at Santa Barbara we had to go by two motor prop plane that airport being too short of runway length to accommodate jets Law requires that the city s adobe character which is to say Spanish Colonial style be preserved As a cab took us to the house where we would stay I noted the overwhelmingly Spanish design of everything including arcade type shopping centers to myself I said This is a place where I reasonably might live If I ever depart the Bay Area Tim s friends with whom we stayed made no impression on me they consisted of retractile genteel well to do people who stayed out of our way They had servants Kirsten and Tim slept in one bedroom I had another a rather small one obviously made use of only when the other rooms had filled up The next morning Tim and Kirsten and I set forth by cab to visit Dr Rachel Garret who would no doubt put us in touch with the dead the next world heal the sick turn water into wine and perform whatever other marvels were necessary Both Tim and Kirsten seemed excited I felt nothing in particular perhaps only a dim consciousness of what we planned what lay ahead not even curiosity only what a starfish living at the bottom of a tidal pond might feel We found Dr Garret to be a rather lively small elderly Irish lady wearing a red sweater over her blouse even though the weather was warm and low heeled shoes and the sort of utility skirt suggesting that she performed all her own chores And who are you again she said cupping her ear She could not even figure out who stood before her on her porch Not an encouraging beginning I said to myself Presently the four of us sat in a darkened living room drinking tea and hearing from Dr Garret a narration delivered with enthusiasm of the heroism of the IRA to which she told us proudly she contributed all the money she took in via her seances However she informed us seance was the wrong word it suggests the occult What Dr Garret did belonged within the realm of the perfectly natural one could rightly call it a science I saw in a corner of the living room among the other archaic furniture a Magnavox radio phonograph of the Forties a large one the kind with two identical twelve inch speakers On each side of the Magnavox stacks of records albums of Bing Crosby and Nat Cole and all the other trash of that period could be discerned I wondered if Dr Garret still listened to them I wondered if in her supernatural fashion she had learned about long playing records and the artists of today Probably not To me Dr Garret said And you're their daughter No I said My daughter in law Tim said You have an Indian guide Dr Garret said to me brightly Really I murmured He s standing just behind you to your left He has very long hair And behind you on your right side stands your great grandfather on your father s side They are always with you I had a feeling that was the case I said Kirsten gave me one of her mixed looks I said no more I settled back against the couch with all its pillows noted a fern growing in a huge clay pot near the doors leading to the garden I noted assorted uninstructive pictures on the walls including several famous loser pictures of the Twenties Is it about the son Dr Garret said Yes Tim said I felt as if I had found my way into Gian Carlo Menotti s opera The Medium which Menotti describes in his album liner notes for Columbia Records as set in Mme Flora s weird and shabby Parlor That is the trouble with education I realized you have been everywhere before seen everything vicariously it has all already happened to you We are Mr and Mrs Gobineau visiting Mme Flora a fraud and lunatic Mr and Mrs Gobineau have been coming to Mme Flora s seances or rather scientific sessions every week for nearly two years as I recall What a drag Worst of all the money Tim will be paying her goes to kill British soldiers this is a fund raiser for terrorists Great What is your son s name Dr Garret asked She sat in an ancient wicker chair leaning back her hands clasped together her eyes slowly shutting She had begun to breathe through her mouth as the very ill do her skin resembled that of a chicken with bits of hair here and there little tufts like minor scarcely watered plants The whole room and everything in it now possessed a vegetable quality totally lacking in vitality I felt myself drained and being drained my own energy taken away Perhaps the light or lack of light gave me this impression I did not find it pleasant Jeff Tim said He sat alert his eyes fixed on Dr Garret Kirsten had gotten a cigarette from her purse but did not light it she merely held it she also scrutinized Dr Garret with evident expectations Jeff has passed across to the distant shore Dr Garret said As the newspapers reported I said to myself I had expected a lengthy preamble from Dr Garret to set up the scene I was wrong She launched into it at once Jeff wants you to know that Dr Garret paused as if listening You should feel no guilt Jeff has been trying to reach you for some time He wanted to tell you that he forgives you He has tried one means after another to attract your attention He has stuck pins into your fingers he has broken things he has left notes to you Dr Garret opened her eyes wide Jeff is highly agitated He She broke off He took his own life You are batting a thousand I thought acridly Yes he did Kirsten said as if Dr Garret s statement was a revelation or else confirmed in a startling way something up to now only suspected And violently Dr Garret said I get the impression that he used a gun That s correct Tim said Jeff wants you to know that he is no longer in pain Dr Garret said He was in a great deal of pain when he took his own life He didn t want you to know He suffered from great doubts about the worth of living What does he say to me I said Dr Garret opened her eyes long enough to fathom who had spoken He was my husband I said Jeff says that he loves you and prays for you Dr Garret said He wants you to be happy That and fifty cents I thought will get you a cup of coffee There is more Dr Garret declared A great deal more It s all coming in a rush Oh my Jeff what is it you're trying to tell us She listened silently for a time her face showing agitation The man at the restaurant was a Soviet what Again she opened her eyes wide My goodness A Soviet police agent Jesus I thought But there s nothing to worry about Dr Garret said then showing relief she leaned back God will see that he is punished I glanced questioningly at Kirsten trying to catch her eye I wanted to know what if anything she had said to Dr Garret Kirsten however sat staring fixedly at the old lady apparently dumbfounded So it would seem I had my answer Jeff says Dr Garret said that it is a matter of utmost joy to him that that Kirsten and his father have each other This is a great comfort to him He wants you to know that Who is Kirsten I am Kirsten said He says the old lady continued that he loves you Kirsten said nothing But she listened with more intensity than I had ever seen her display before He felt it was wrong Dr Garret said He says he s sorry but he couldn t help it He feels guilty about it and he would like your forgiveness He has it Tim said Jeff says that he can t forgive himself Dr Garret said He also felt anger toward Kirsten for coming between him and his father It made him feel cut off from his father I get the impression that his father and Kirsten went on a long trip a trip to England and left him behind He felt very badly about that Again the old lady paused Angel is not to smoke any more drugs Dr Garret said then She smokes too much what is it Jeff I can t pick this up clearly Too many numbers I don't know what that means I laughed In spite of myself Does that make any sense to you Dr Garret said to me In a way I said paying out as little line to her as possible Jeff says he s glad about your job at the record store Dr Garret said But She laughed you're not being paid enough He liked it better when you worked at the shop kind of shop A bottle shop Law office and candle shop I said Strange Dr Garret said puzzled Law office and candle shop It was in Berkeley I said Dr Garret said Jeff has something very important to say to Kirsten and his father Her voice now had become faint almost reduced to a rasping whisper As if coming from a vast distance away Traveling over invisible wires strung between stars Jeff has some dreadful news he wants to convey to the two of you This is why he has been trying so badly to get through to you This is why the pins and the burning and the breaking and the disordering and the smearing He has a reason a dreadful reason Silence then Leaning toward Tim I said This is a judgment call but I want to leave No Tim said He shook his head His face showed unhappiness WHAT A PECULIAR mixture of nonsense and the uncanny I thought as we waited for elderly Dr Rachel Garret to go on Mention of Fred Hill the KGB agent mention of Jeff disapproving of my turning on Scraps derived obviously from newspapers how Jeff had died and his probable motivations Lumpen psychoanalysis and scandal sheet garbage and yet stuck in here and there a fragment like a tiny shard that could not be explained Beyond doubt Dr Garret had easy access to most of the knowledge she had divulged but there remained a creepy residuum defined as That which remains after certain deductions are made so this is the right term and I have had a long time many years to mull over it I have mulled and I can explain no part of it How could Dr Garret know about the Bad Luck Restaurant And even if she knew that Kirsten and Tim had met originally at that place how could she have known about Fred Hill or what we supposed was the case with Fred Hill It had been the joke passed endlessly between Jeff and me that the owner of the Bad Luck Restaurant in Berkeley had been a KGB agent but this fact wasn t printed anywhere no one had ever written it down except perhaps in the computers of the FBI and of course at KGB GHQ in Moscow and it was only speculation anyhow The issue of my turning on could be a shrewd guess since I lived and worked in Berkeley and as everyone in the world knows all the people in Berkeley do dope regularly in fact do it to excess A medium is traditionally one who relies on a potpourri of hunches common knowledge clues unknowingly delivered by the audience itself delivered unintentionally and then handed back and of course the standard bullshit such as Jeff loves you and Jeff isn t in any more pain and Jeff felt a lot of doubt generalizations available to anyone at any time given the known facts Yet an eerie sensation held me even though I knew that this old Irish lady who gave money or said she gave money to the Irish Republican Army was a fraud that we three collectively were being fleeced out of our money fleeced too in the sense that our credulity was being pandered to and manipulated by someone in the business of doing this a professional The primary medium it sounded like the medical term for cancer the primary cancer Dr Mason had undoubtedly passed on everything he had learned and knew this is how mediums work it and we all know this The time to have left was before the revelation came and now it was going to come dumped on us by an unscrupulous old lady with dollar signs in her eyes and a clever ability to fathom the weak links in human psyches But we didn t leave and so it followed as the night the day that we got to hear from Dr Garret what had so agitated Jeff causing him to come back to Tim and Kirsten as the occult phenomena that they logged each day for Tim s forthcoming book It seemed to me as it Rachel Garret had become very old as she sat in her wicker chair and I thought about the ancient sibyl I could not remember which sibyl it had been the one at Delphi or at Cumae who had asked for immortality but had neglected to stipulate that she remain young whereupon she lived forever but got so old that eventually her friends hung her up on the wall in a bag Rachel Garret resembled that tattered wisp of skin and fragile bones whispering out of the bag nailed to the wall what wall in what city of the Empire I do not know perhaps the sibyl is still there perhaps this being who faced us as Rachel Garret was in fact that same sibyl in any case I did not want to hear what she had to say I wanted to leave Sit down Kirsten said I realized then that I had stood without intending to Flight reaction I said to myself Instinctive Upon experiencing close adversaries The lizard part of the brain Rachel Garret whispered Kirsten But now she pronounced it correctly Shishen which I did not do nor had Jeff nor did Tim But that was how she pronounced it herself and gave up on getting anyone else to at least in the States At this Kirsten gave a muffled gasp The old lady in the wicker chair said Ultima Cumaei venit iam carminis aetas magnus ab integro saeclorum nascitur ordo lam redit et Virgo redeunt Saturnia regna iam nova My God Tim said It s the Fourth Eclogue Of Virgil That s enough Kirsten said faintly I thought The old lady is reading my mind She knows I thought about the sibyl Speaking to me Rachel Garret said Dies irae dies illa Solvet saeclum in favilla Teste David cum Sibylla Yes she is reading my mind I realized She even knows that I know it as I think she reads my thoughts back to me Mors Kirsten nunc carpit Rachel Garret whispered Hodie Calamitas timeo She drew herself up in her wicker chair What did she say Kirsten said to Tim You are going to die very soon Rachel Garret said to her in a calm voice I thought today but not today I saw it here But not quite yet Jeff says so This is why he came back to warn you Die how Tim said He isn t sure Rachel Garret said Violently Tim said He doesn t know the old lady said But they are preparing a place for you Kirsten All her agitation had gone now she seemed completely composed This is awful news she said I'm sorry Kirsten No wonder Jeff caused all the many disturbances Usually there is a reason they return for a good reason Can anything be done Tim said Jeff thinks that it is inevitable the old lady said after a time Then what was the point of him coming back Kirsten said savagely her face was white He wanted to warn his father as well the old lady said About what I said Rachel Garret said He has a chance to live No Jeff says His father will die soon after Kirsten Both of you are going to perish It won t be long There is some uncertainty about the father but none about the woman If I could give you more information I would Jeff is still with me but he doesn t know any more She shut her eyes and sighed All the vitality it seemed had gone out of her as she sat in the old chair her hands clasped together then suddenly she leaned forward and picked up her teacup Jeff was so anxious that you know she said in a bright chipper voice He feels so much better now She smiled at us Still ashen Kirsten murmured Is it all right if I smoke Oh I d prefer you didn t smoke Dr Garret said But if you feel you must Thank you Her hand trembling Kirsten lit her cigarette She stared and stared at the old lady with dislike and fury or so it seemed to me I thought Kill the Spartan messengers lady hold them responsible We want to thank you very much Tim said to Dr Garret in a level controlled voice he began by degrees to rouse himself to take command of the situation So then Jeff is beyond any doubt whatsoever alive in the after world And it has been he who has come to us with what we call the phenomena Oh indeed Dr Garret said But Leonard told you that Leonard Mason You knew that already I said Could it have been an evil spirit posing as Jeff And not actually Jeff Her eyes bright Dr Garret nodded You are exceedingly alert young lady Yes it certainly could have been But it was not One learns to tell the difference I found no malice in him only concern and love Angel your name is Angel isn t it your husband apologizes to you for his feelings about Kirsten He knows that it is unfair to you But he thinks that you will understand I said nothing Did I get your name right Rachel Garret asked me in a timid and uncertain tone Yes I said To Kirsten I said Let me have a puff on your cigarette Here Kirsten passed it to me Keep it I'm not supposed to smoke To Tim she said Well Shall we go I don't see any reason for staying any longer She reached for her purse and coat Tim paid Dr Garret I did not see how much but it took the form of cash not a check and then phoned for a cab Ten minutes later the three of us rode back down the winding hillside roads to the house where we had accommodated ourselves Time passed and then half to himself Tim said That was the same eclogue of Virgil that I read to you That day I remember I said It seems a remarkable coincidence Tim said There is no way she could have known it is a favorite of mine Of course it is the most famous of his eclogues but that would scarcely account for it I have never heard anyone else quote it but myself It was as if I were hearing my own thoughts read back to me aloud when Dr Garret lapsed into Latin And I I too had experienced that I realized Tim had expressed it perfectly Perfectly and precisely Tim I said did you say anything to Dr Mason about the Bad Luck Restaurant Eying me Tim said What is the Bad Luck Restaurant Where we met Kirsten said No Tim said I don't even remember the name of it I remember what we had to eat I had abalone Did you ever tell anybody I said to him anybody at all at any time anywhere about Fred Hill I don't know anybody by that name Tim said I'm sorry He rubbed his eyes wearily They read your mind Kirsten said That s where they get it She knew my health was bad She knows I'm worried about the spot on my lung What spot I said This was the first I had heard about it Have you been in for more tests When Kirsten did not answer Tim said She showed a spot Several weeks ago It was a routine X ray They don't think it means anything It means I'm going to die Kirsten said bitingly with palpable venom You heard her the old bitch Kill the Spartan runners I said Furiously Kirsten lashed at me Is that one of your Berkeley educated remarks Please Tim said in a faint voice I said It s not her fault We pay a hundred dollars to be told we re both going to die Kirsten said and then on top of that according to you we should be grateful She scrutinized me with what struck me as psychotic malice exceeding anything I had ever seen in her or in anyone else you're okay she didn t say anything was going to happen to you you cunt You little Berkeley cunt you're doing fine I'm going to die and you get to have Tim all to yourself with Jeff dead and now me I think you set it up you're involved goddamn you Reaching she took a swing at me there in the back of the Yellow Cab she tried to hit me I drew back horrified Grabbing her with both hands Tim pinned her against the side of the cab against the door If I ever hear you use that word again he said you are out of my life forever You prick Kirsten said After that we drove in silence The only sound was the occasional racket of the cab company s dispatcher from the driver s two way radio Let s stop somewhere for a drink Kirsten said as we approached the house I don't want to have to deal with those awful mousy people I just can t I want to shop To Tim she said We ll let you off Angel and I ll go shopping I really can t take any more today I said I don't feel like shopping right now Please Kirsten said tightly Tim said to me in a gentle voice Do it as a favor to both of us He opened the cab door Okay I said After giving Kirsten money all the money he had with him apparently Tim got out of the cab we shut the door after him and presently arrived at the downtown shopping district of Santa Barbara with all the many lovely little shops and their various handcrafted artifacts Soon Kirsten and I sat together in a bar a nice bar subdued with low music playing Through the open doors we could see people strolling around in the bright midday sunlight Shit Kirsten said as she sipped her vodka collins What a thing to find out That you're going to die Dr Garret worked backward from Jeff s return I said How do you mean She stirred her drink Jeff had come back to you That s the given So Garret summoned up a reason to explain it the most dramatic reason she could find He returned for a reason That s why they return It s a commonplace It s like I gestured Like the ghost in Hamlet Gazing at me quizzically Kirsten said In Berkeley there is an intellectual reason for everything The ghost warns Hamlet that Claudius is a murderer that he murdered him Hamlet s father What s Hamlet s father s name He s just called Hamlet s father the late king Kirsten an owlish expression on her face said No his father is named Hamlet too Ten bucks says otherwise She extended her hand we shook The play Kirsten said instead of being called Hamlet should properly be called Hamlet Junior We both laughed I mean Kirsten said this is just sick We re sick going to that medium Coming all this way of course Tim is meeting with those double domed eggheads from the think tank You know where he really wants to work don't ever say this to anyone but he d like to work for the Center for the Study of Democratic Institutions This whole business about Jeff coming back She sipped her drink It s cost Tim a lot He doesn t have to bring out the book He could drop the project As if thinking aloud Kirsten said How do those mediums do it It s ESP they can pick up your anxieties Somehow the old biddy knew I have medical problems It goes back to that damn peritonitis that s public knowledge that I had that There s a central file they keep mediums of the world Media I guess is the plural And my cancer They know I'm plagued with a second rate body sort of a used car A lemon God sold me a lemon for a body You should have told me about the spot It s none of your business I care about you Dike Kirsten said Homo That s why Jeff killed himself because you and I are in love with each other Both of us had begun laughing now we bumped heads and I put my arm around her I have this joke for you We re not supposed to call Mexicans greasers any more right She lowered her voice We re supposed to call them Lubricanos I said She glanced at me Well fuck you Let s pick up somebody I said I want to shop You pick up somebody In a more somber tone she said This is a beautiful city We may be living down here you realize Would you stay up in Berkeley if Tim and I moved down here I don't know I said You and your Berkeley friends The Greater East Bay Co Sexual Communal Free Love Exchange Partners Enterprise Unlimited What is it about Berkeley Angel Why do you stay there The house I said And I thought Memories of Jeff In connection with the house The Co op on University Avenue where we used to shop I like the coffee houses on the Avenue I said Especially Larry Blake s One time Larry Blake came over to Jeff and me downstairs in the Ratskeller he was so nice to us And I like Tilden Park And the campus I said to myself I can never free myself of that The eucalyptus grove down by Oxford The library It s my home I said You d get accustomed to Santa Barbara I said You shouldn t call me a cunt in front of Tim He might get ideas If I die Kirsten said would you sleep with him I mean seriously you're not going to die Dr Spooky says I am Dr Spooky I said is full of it Do you think so God it was weird Kirsten shivered I felt she could read my mind that she was tapping it like you tap a maple tree Reading my own fears back to me Would you sleep with Tim Answer me seriously I need to know It would be incest Why Oh okay Well it s already a sin a sin for him why not add incest If Jeff is in heaven and they re preparing a place for me apparently I'm going to go to heaven That s a relief I just don't know how seriously to take what Dr Garret said Take it with the entire output of salt from the Polish salt mines for one full calendar year But Kirsten said it is Jeff coming back to us Now we have it confirmed But if I'm going to believe that don't I have to believe the other the prophecy As I listened to her a line from Dido and Aeneas entered my head both the music and the words The Trojan Prince you know is bound By Fate to seek Italian ground The Queen and he are now in chase Why had that come to mind The sorceress Jeff had quoted her or I had the music had been a part of our lives and I was thinking about Jeff now and the things that had bound us together Fate I thought Predestination doctrine of the church based on Augustine and Paul Tim had once told me that Christianity as a Mystery Religion had come into existence as a means of abolishing the tyranny of fate only to reintroduce it as predestination in fact double predestination some predestined to hell some to heaven Calvin s doctrine We don't have fate any more I said That went out with astrology with the ancient world Tim explained it to me Kirsten said He explained it to me too but the dead have precognition they re outside of time That s why you raise the spirits of the dead to get advice from them about the future they know the future To them it s already happened They re like God They see everything Necromancy we re like Dr Dee in Elizabethan England We have access to this marvelous supernatural power it s better than the Holy Spirit who also grants the ability to foresee the future to prophesy Through that wizened old lady we get Jeff s absolute knowledge that I'm going to kick off in the near future How can you doubt it Readily I said But she knew about the Bad Luck Restaurant You see Angel we either reject it all or accept it all we don't get to pick and choose And if we reject it then Jeff didn t come back to us and we re nuts And if we accept it he did come back to us which is fine as far as that goes but then we have to face the fact that I'm going to die I thought And Tim too You ve forgotten about that in your concern for yourself As is typical of you What s the matter Kirsten said Well she said Tim would die too Tim has Christ on his side he s immortal Didn t you know that Bishops live forever The first bishop Peter I imagine is still alive somewhere drawing a salary Bishops live eternally and they get paid a lot I die and I get paid almost nothing It beats working in a record store I said Not really Everything about your life is out in the open at least you don't have to skulk around like a second story man This book of Tim s it s going to be clear as day to everyone who reads it that Tim and I are sleeping together We were in England together we witnessed the phenomena together Perhaps this is God s revenge against us for our sins this prophecy by that old lady Sleep with a bishop and die it s like See Rome and die Well I can t say it s been worth it I really can t I d rather be a record clerk in Berkeley like you but then I d have to be young like you to get the full benefits I said My husband is dead I don't have all the breaks And you don't have the guilt Balls I said I have plenty of guilt Why Jeff well anyhow it wasn t your fault We share the guilt I said All of us For the death of someone who was programmed to die You only kill yourself if the DNA death strip tells you to it s in the DNA didn t you know that Or it s what they call a script which is what Eric Berne taught He s dead you know his death script or strip or whatever caught up with him proving him right His father died and he died the exact same age It s like Chardin who desired to die on Good Friday and got his wish This is morbid I said Right Kirsten nodded I just heard a while ago that I'm doomed to die I feel very morbid and so would you except that you're exempt for some reason Maybe because you don't have a spot on your lung and you never had cancer Why doesn t that old lady die Why is it me and Tim I think Jeff s malicious saying that it s one of those self fulfilling prophecies you hear about He tells Dr Spooky I'm going to die and as a result I die and Jeff enjoys it because he hated me for sleeping with his father The hell with both of them It goes along with the pins stuck under my fingernails its hate hate toward me I can tell hate when I see it I hope Tim points that out in his book well he will because I'm writing most of it he doesn t have the time and if you want to know the truth the talent either All his sentences run together He has logorrhea if you want to know the blunt truth from the speed he takes I said I don't want to know Have you and Tim slept together No I said amazed Bull Christ I said you're crazy Tell me it s due to the reds I take I stared at her she stared back Unwinkingly her face taut you're crazy I said Kirsten said You have turned Tim against me I what He thinks that Jeff would be alive if it hadn t been for me but it was his idea for us to get sexually involved You I could not think what to say Your mood swings are getting greater I said finally Kirsten said in a fierce grating voice I see more and more clearly Come on She finished her drink and slid from her stool tottered grinned at me Let s go shop Let s buy a whole lot of Indian silver jewelry imported from Mexico they sell it here You regard me as old and sick and a red freak don't you Tim and I have discussed it your view of me He considers it damaging to me and defamatory He s going to talk to you about it sometime Get prepared he s going to quote canon law It s against canon law to bear false witness He doesn t consider you a very good Christian in fact not a Christian at all He doesn t really like you Did you know that I said nothing Christians are judgmental Kirsten said and bishops even more so I have to live with the fact that Tim confesses every week to the sin of sleeping with me do you know how that feels It is quite painful And now he has me going I take Communion and I confess It s sick Christianity is sick I want him to step down as bishop I want him to go into the private sector Oh I said I understood then Tim could then come out in the open and proclaim her his relationship with her Strange I thought that it never entered my mind When he is working for that think tank Kirsten said the stigma and the hiding will be gone because they don't care They re just secular people they re not Christians they don't condemn others They re not saved I ll tell you something Angel Because of me Tim is cut off from God This is terrible for him and for me he has to get up every Sunday and preach knowing that because of me he and God are severed as in the original Fall Because of me Bishop Timothy Archer is recapitulating the primordial Fall in himself and he fell voluntarily he chose it No one made him fall or told him to do it It s my fault I should have said no to him when he first asked me to sleep with him It would have been a lot better but I didn t know a rat s ass about Christianity I didn t comprehend what it signified for him and what eventually it would signify for me as the damn stuff oozed out all over me that Pauline doctrine of sin Original Sin What a demented doctrine that man is born evil how cruel it is It s not found in Judaism Paul made it up to explain the Crucifixion To make sense out of Christ s death which in fact makes no sense Death for nothing unless you believe in Original Sin Do you believe in it now I asked I believe I ve sinned I don't know if I was born that way But it s true now You need therapy The whole church needs therapy Old Dr Batshit could take one look at me and Tim and know we re sleeping together the whole media news network knows it and when Tim s book comes out he has to step down it has nothing to do with his faith or lack of faith in Christ it has to do with me I'm forcing him out of his career not his lack of faith I'm doing it That cracked old lady only read back to me what I already knew that you can t do what we re doing you can do it but you have to pay for it I d just as soon be dead I really would This is no life Every time we go somewhere fly somewhere we have to get two hotel rooms one for each of us and then I slip up the hall into his room Dr Batshit didn t have to be a psychic to ferret it all out it was written on our faces Come on let s shop I said you're going to have to lend me some money I didn t bring enough along to shop It s the Episcopal Church s money She opened her purse Be my guest You hate yourself I said I intended to add the word unfairly but Kirsten interrupted me I hate the position I'm in I hate what Tim has done to me made me ashamed of myself and my body and being a woman Is this why we founded FEM I never dreamed I d ever be in this situation like a forty dollar whore Sometime you and I should talk the way we used to talk before I was busy all the time writing his speeches and making his appointments the bishop s secretary who makes sure he doesn t reveal in public the fool that he is the child that he is I'm the one who has all the responsibility and I'm treated like garbage She handed me some money from her purse grabbed out at random I accepted it and felt vast guilt but I took the money anyhow As Kirsten said it belonged to the Episcopal Church One thing I have learned she said as we left the bar and emerged into the daylight is to read the fine print I ll say one thing for that old lady I said She certainly loosened up your tongue No it s being out of San Francisco You haven t seen me out of the Bay Area and Grace Cathedral before I don't like you and I don't like being a cheap whore and I don't particularly like my life in general I'm not sure I even like Tim I'm not sure I want to continue with this any of this That apartment I had a much better apartment before I met Tim although I suppose that doesn t count it s not supposed to anyhow But I had a very rewarding life But I was programmed by my DNA to get mixed up with Tim and now some old skuzz bag rails at me that I'm going to die You know what my feeling is about that my real feeling It no longer matters to me I knew it anyway She just read my own thoughts back to me and you know it That is the one thing that sticks in my mind from this seance or whatever we re supposed to call it I heard someone express my realizations about myself and my life and what s become of me It gives me courage to face what I have to face and do what I have to do And what is that You ll see in due time I ve come to an important decision This today helped clear my mind I think I understand She spoke no further It was Kirsten s custom to cast a veil of mystery over her connivings that way she supposed she added an element of glamour But in fact she did not She only murked up the situation for herself most of all I let the subject drop Together then we sauntered off in search of ways to spend the church s wealth We returned to San Francisco at the end of the week laden with purchases and feeling tired The bishop had secured covertly not for publication a post with the Santa Barbara think tank It would be announced presently that he intended to resign from his post as Bishop of the Diocese of California the announcement would be coming ineluctably his decision having been made his new job arranged for nailed down Meanwhile Kirsten checked into Mount Zion Hospital for further tests Her apprehension had made her taciturn and morose I visited her at the hospital but she had little to say As I sat beside her bed ill at ease and wishing I were elsewhere Kirsten fussed with her hair and complained I left dissatisfied with myself basically I seemed to have lost my ability to communicate with her my best friend really and our relationship was dwindling along with her spirits At this time the bishop had in his possession the galleys for his book dealing with Jeff s return from the next world Tim had decided on the title Here Tyrant Death which I had suggested to him it is from Handel s Belshazzar and reads in full Here tyrant Death thy terrors end He quoted it in context in the book itself Busy as always over extended and preoccupied with a hundred and one major matters he elected to bring the galleys to Kirsten in the hospital he left them with her to proofread and at once departed I found her lying propped up a cigarette in one hand a pen in the other the long galley pages propped up on her knees It was evident that she was furious Can you believe this she said by way of greeting I can do them I said seating myself on the edge of the bed Not if I throw up on them After you're dead you ll work even harder Kirsten said No I won t work at all That s the point As I read over this thing I keep asking myself Who is going to believe this crap I mean it is crap Let s face it Look She pointed to a section on the galley page and I read it over My reaction tallied with hers the prose was turgid vague and disastrously pompous Obviously Tim had dictated it at his rush rush speeded up let s get it over with velocity Equally obviously he had never once looked back I thought to myself The title should be Look Backward Idiot Start with the final page I said and work forward That way you won t have to read it I'm going to drop them Oops She simulated dropping the galleys onto the floor catching them just in time Does the order matter on these Let s shuffle them Write in stuff I said Write in This really sucks Or Your mother wears Army boots Kirsten pretending to write said Jeff manifested himself to us naked with his pecker in his hand He was singing The Stars and Stripes Forever Both of us were laughing now I collapsed against her and we embraced I ll give you one hundred dollars if you write that in I said almost unable to talk I ll just turn it over to the IRA No I said To the IRS Kirsten said I don't report my earnings Hookers don't have to Her mood changed then her spirit palpably ebbed away Gently she patted me on the arm and then she kissed me What s that for I said touched They think the spot means I have a tumor Oh no I said Yep Well that s the long and the short of it She pushed me away then with stifled ill stifled anger Can they do anything I mean they can They can operate they can remove the lung And you're still smoking It s a little late to give up cigarettes What the hell This raises an interesting question I'm not the first to ask it When you're resurrected in the flesh are you resurrected in a perfect form or do you have all the scars and injuries and defects you had while alive Jesus showed Thomas his wounds he had Thomas thrust his hand into his Jesus side Did you know that the church was born from that wound That s what the Roman Catholics believe Blood and water flowed from the wound the spear wound while he was on the cross It s a vagina Jesus vagina She did not seem to be joking she seemed now solemn and pensive A mystical notion of a spiritual second birth Christ gave birth to us all I seated myself on the chair beside the bed saying nothing The news the medical report stunned and terrified me I could not respond Kirsten however looked composed They have given her tranks I realized As they do when they deliver this sort of news You consider yourself a Christian now I said finally unable to think up anything else anything more appropriate The fox hole phenomenon Kirsten said What do you think of the title Here Tyrant Death I picked it I said She gazed at me with intensity Why are you looking at me like that I said Tim said he picked it Well he did I gave him the quotation One among a group I submitted several When was this I don't know Some time ago I forget Why Kirsten said It s a terrible title I abominated it when I first saw it I didn t see it until he dumped these galleys in my lap literally in my lap He never asked She broke off then stubbed her cigarette out It s like somebody s idea of what a book title ought to consist of A parody of a book title By someone who never titled a book before I'm surprised his editor didn t object Is all this directed at me I said I don't know You figure it out She began then to scrutinize the galleys she ignored me Do you want me to go I said awkwardly after a time Kirsten said I really don't care what you do She continued with her work presently she halted a moment to light up another cigarette I saw then that the ashtray by her bed overflowed with half smoked stubbed out cigarettes I LEARNED OF her suicide by hearing it from Tim on the phone My little brother had come over to the house to visit me it was on Sunday so I didn t have to go to the Musik Shop that day I had to stand there and listen to Tim telling me that Kirsten had just slipped away I could see my little brother who had really been fond of Kirsten he was assembling a balsawood model of a Spad Thirteen he knew the call was from Tim but of course he didn t know that now Kirsten along with Jeff was dead you're a strong person Tim s voice sounded in my ear I know you will be able to stand up to this I saw it coming I said Yes Tim said He sounded matter of fact but I knew his heart was breaking Barbiturates I said She took well they re not sure She took them and timed herself She waited Then she walked in and told me And then she fell I knew what it was He added Tomorrow she was supposed to go back to Mount Zion You called The paramedics came Tim said and they took her right to the hospital They tried everything What she had done was build up the maximum amount in her system already so that what she took as the overdose That s how it s done I said That way pumping her stomach doesn t help it s already in the system Do you want to come over here Tim said To the City I would really appreciate your being here I have Harvey with me I said My little brother glanced up To him I said Kirsten died Oh He nodded and after a moment returned to his balsawood Spad It s like Wozzeck I thought Exactly like the end of Wozzeck There I go Berkeley intellectual viewing everything in terms of culture of opera of novel oratorio and poem Not to mention play Du Define Mutter ist tot And Marien s child says Hope hope Hopp hopp Hopp hopp It will break you I thought if you keep this up The little boy assembling a model airplane and not understanding double horror and both happening to me now I ll come over there I said to Tim As soon as I can find someone to take care of Harvey You could bring him Tim said No Reflexively I shook my head I got a neighbor to take Harvey for the rest of the day and shortly I was on my way to San Francisco driving over the Bay Bridge in my Honda And still the words of Berg s opera percolated obsessively through my mind The huntsman s life is gay and free Shooting is free for all There would I huntsman be There would I be I mean I said to myself George Büchner s words he wrote the damn thing As I drove I cried tears ran down my face I turned on the car radio and pressed button after button station after station On a rock station I picked up an old Santana track I turned up the volume and as the music rebounded throughout my little car I screamed And I heard You Your mother is dead I narrowly missed rear ending a huge American car I had to swerve into the lane to my right Slow down I said to myself Fuck this I thought two deaths are enough You want to make it three Then just keep driving the way you're driving three plus the people in the other car And then I remembered Bill Dingaling Bill Lundborg off in an asylum somewhere Had Tim called him I should tell him I said to myself You poor miserable fucked up son of a bitch I said to myself remembering Bill and his gentle pudgy face That air of sweetness like new clover about him him and his dumb pants and dumb look like a cow a contented cow The Post Office is in for another round of their windows smashed I realized he will walk down there and start hitting the great plate glass windows with his fists until blood runs down his arms And then they ll lock him up again in one place or another it doesn t matter which because he doesn t know the difference How could she do it to him I asked myself What malice What abysmal cruelty toward us all She really hated us This is our punishment I ll always think I'm responsible Tim will always think he s responsible Bill likewise And of course none of us is and yet in a sense all of us are but anyhow it is beside the point after the fact null and moot and void totally void as in the infinite void the sublime non Being of God There is a line somewhere in Wozzeck that translates out to roughly The world is awful Yes I said to myself as I shot across the Bay Bridge not giving a fuck how fast I drove that sums it up That is high art The world is awful That says it all This is what we pay composers and painters and the great writers to do tell us this from figuring this out they earn a living What masterful incisive insight What penetrating intelligence A rat in a drain ditch could tell you the same thing were it able to talk If rats could talk I d do anything they said Black girl I knew Not rats with her it s rats for me for her she said it was spiders viz If spiders could talk That time she got the runs while we were up in Tilden Park and we had to drive her home Neurotic lady Married to a white guy what was his name Only in Berkeley Viz a short form of Visigoths the noble Goths Visitation as in Visitation from the dead from the next world That old lady bears some real responsibility for this if any one single person done did it she done did it But that s killing the Spartan runners now they have me doing it myself after all the warnings WARNING THIS LADY IS NUTS Get out of my way May you all be fucked forever all of you in your washed big cars I thought Destructive War thy limits know here tyrant Death thy terrors end To tyrants only I'm a foe to virtue and her friends a friend And then it says it again Here tyrant Death It s a great title it s not a parody That s what did it Tim using my title and of course in his usual chickenshit fashion not bothering or remembering to tell her In fact telling her that he thought of it He probably thinks so Every valuable idea in the history of the world was thought into being by Timothy Archer He invented the heliocentric solar system model We d still have the geocentric one if it hadn t been for him Where does Bishop Archer end and God begin Good point Ask him he ll tell you quoting from books No single thing abides and all things are fucked up I thought That s how it should have been worded I ll suggest that to Tim for Kirsten s gravestone Teaching school in Norway the Swedish cretin A million nasty things I said to her in the guise of play Her brain recorded them and played them back to her late at night when she couldn t sleep while Tim snoozed on she couldn t sleep and took more and more downers those barbiturates that killed her we knew they would the only issue was whether it would be an accident or a purposeful overdose assuming there is a difference My instructions required me to meet with Tim at the Tenderloin apartment before going on with him then to Grace Cathedral I had expected to find him red eyed and distraught However to my surprise Tim looked stronger more powerfully put together even in a literal sense larger than I had ever seen him before He said as he put his arms around me and hugged me I have a terrible fight on my hands From here on in You mean the scandal I said It ll be in the papers and on the news I guess I destroyed part of her suicide note The police are reading what s left They ve been here Probably they ll be coming back I do have influence but I can t keep the news quiet All I can hope for is to keep it retained as speculation What did the note say The part I destroyed I don't remember It s gone It had to do with us her feelings about me I had no choice Guess so I said As to it being suicide there is no doubt And the motive is of course her fear that she had cancer again And they re aware that she was a barbiturate addict Would you describe her that way I said An addict Certainly That s not disputed How long have you known Since I met her Since I first saw her taking them You knew Yes I said I knew Sit down and have some coffee Tim said He left the living room for the kitchen automatically I seated myself on the familiar couch wondering if any cigarettes could be found anywhere in the apartment What do you take in your coffee Tim stood at the kitchen doorway I forget I said It doesn t matter Would you rather have a drink No I shook my head Do you realize Tim said that this proves Rachel Garret right I know I said Jeff wanted to warn her Warn Kirsten So it would seem And I'm going to die next I glanced up That s what Jeff said Tim said Guess so I said It will be a terrible fight but I will win I am not going to follow them follow Jeff and Kirsten His tone rang with harshness with indignation This is what Christ came to the world to save man from this sort of determinism this rule The future can be changed I hope so I said My hope is in Jesus Christ Tim said While you still have the light believe in the light and you will become sons of light John twelve thirty six Do not let your hearts be troubled Trust in God still and trust in me John fourteen one Blessings on him who comes in the name of the Lord Matthew twenty three thirty nine Breathing heavily his great chest rising and falling Tim gazing at me pointed at me saying I'm not going that way Angel Each of them did it intentionally but I will never do it I will never go like that like a sheep to slaughter Thank God I thought You are going to fight Prophecy or no prophecy Tim said Even if Rachel were the sibyl herself even then I wouldn t walk toward it willingly like a dumb animal to have my throat cut to be offered up His eyes blazed hot with intensity and fire I had seen him this way sometimes at Grace Cathedral when he preached this Tim Archer spoke with the authority vested in him by the Apostle Peter himself through the line of apostolic succession unbroken in and for the Episcopal Church As we drove to Grace Cathedral in my Honda Tim said to me I see myself falling into Wallenstein s fate Catering to astrology Casting horoscopes You mean Dr Garret I said Yes I mean her and Dr Mason they re not doctors of any kind That wasn t Jeff He never came back from the next world There is no truth in it Stupidity as that poor boy said her son Oh Lord I haven t called her son I said I ll tell him It will finish him off Tim said No maybe it won t He may be stronger than we give him credit for He could see through all that nonsense about Jeff coming back You get to tell the truth I said when you're schizophrenic Then more people should be schizophrenic What is this a matter of the emperor s new clothes You knew too but you didn t say I said It s not a matter of knowing It has to do with evaluation But you never believed it After a pause I said I'm not sure Kirsten is dead Tim said because we believed in nonsense Both of us And we believed because we wanted to believe I have not that motive now Guess not If we had ruthlessly faced the truth Kirsten would be alive now All I can hope is to put an end to it here and now and accompany her at some later date Garret and Mason could see that Kirsten was sick They took advantage of a sick disturbed woman and now she s dead I hold them responsible He paused and then said I had been attempting to get Kirsten to go into the hospital for drug detox I have several friends who re in that field here in San Francisco I was well aware of her addiction and I knew that only professionals could help her I had to go through this myself as you know with alcohol I said nothing I merely drove It s too late to stop the book Tim said Couldn t you phone your editor and The book is their property now I said They re a totally reputable publishing house They would listen to you if you instructed them to withdraw the book They ve sent out promotional prepublication material They ve circulated bound galleys and Xerox copies of the manuscript What I ll do Tim pondered I ll write another book That tells about Kirsten s death and my reevaluation of the occult That s the best avenue for me to pursue I think you should withdraw Here Tyrant Death His mind however had been made up he shook his head vigorously No it should be allowed to come out as planned I ve had years of experience with these matters you should face up to your own folly my own I am referring to of course and then after you ve faced up to it set about correcting it My next book will be that correction How much was the advance Glancing swiftly at me Tim said Not much considering its sales potential Ten thousand on my signing the contract then another ten thousand when I delivered the completed manuscript to them And there will be a final ten thousand when the book is released Thirty thousand dollars is a lot of money Half to himself reflecting Tim said I think I ll add a dedication to it A dedication to Kirsten In memoriam And say a few things about my feeling for her You could dedicate it to both of them I said Both Jeff and Kirsten And say But for the grace of God Very appropriate Tim said Add me and Bill I said While you're at it We re part of this movie Movie A Berkeley expression Only it s not a movie it s the opera Wozzeck by Alban Berg They all die except the little boy riding his wooden horse I ll have to phone in the dedication Tim said The galleys are already back in New York corrected She finished then Her job Yes he said vaguely Did she do it right After all she wasn t feeling too well I assume she did it correctly I didn t look them over you're going to have a Mass said for her aren't you I said At Grace Oh yes That s one of the reasons I'm I think you should get Kiss I said It s a group a very highly thought of rock group After all you had been planning a rock mass anyhow Did she like Kiss Second only to Sha Na Na I said Then we should get Sha Na Na Tim said We drove for a time in silence The Patti Smith Group I said suddenly Let me ask you Tim said about several things regarding Kirsten I am here to answer any question I said At the service I want to read poems that she loved Can you give me the names of a few He got from his coat pocket a notebook and gold pen holding them he waited There is a very beautiful poem about a snake I said by D H Lawrence She loved it don't ask me to quote it I can t quote it just now I'm sorry I shut my eyes trying not to cry AT THE SERVICE Bishop Timothy Archer read the D H Lawrence poem about the snake he read it wonderfully and I saw how moved the people were although not many mourners had shown up Not that many people knew Kirsten Lundborg I kept seeking to locate her son Bill somewhere in the cathedral When I had phoned him to tell him the news he had showed little response I think he foresaw it At this time the hospital and the house of many slammers held no power over him Bill had earned his freedom to walk around or to paint cars or whatever he did However he currently amused himself in his earnest fashion The cobwebs departed Bishop Archer s mind when Kirsten killed herself so it would seem her death had served a useful purpose although a purpose unequal to our loss It amazes me the sobering power of human death It outweighs all words all arguments it is the ultimate force It coerces your attention and your time And it leaves you changed How Tim could derive strength from death the death of a person he loved baffled me I could not fathom it but this was the sort of quality in him that made him good good at his job good as a human being The worse things got the stronger he became he did not like death but he did not fear it He comprehended it once the cobwebs left He had tried out the bullshit solution of seances and superstition and that hadn t worked it simply brought on more death So now he shifted gears and tried out being rational He had a profound motive his own life had been placed on the line like bait Bait to tempt what the ancients called a sinister fate meaning premature death death before its time The thinkers of antiquity did not regard death per se as evil because death comes to all what they correctly perceived as evil was premature death death coming before the person could complete his work Lopped off as it were before ripe a hard green little apple that death took and then tossed away as being of no interest even to death Bishop Archer had by no means completed his work and by no means did he intend to be lopped off severed from life He now correctly perceived himself sliding by degrees into the fate that had overtaken Wallenstein first the superstition and credulity then run through with a halberd by an otherwise historically undistinguished English captain named Walter Devereux Wallenstein had pleaded in vain for quarter when the halberd is in the foe s hand it is usually too late to plead for quarter At that final instant Wallenstein roused from sleep had probably also been roused from his mental stupor I would guess that the swift realization came to him as the enemy soldiers broke into his bedroom that all the astrological charts and all the horoscopes in the world had been of no use to him for he had not foreseen this and was caught The difference between Wallenstein and Tim however was great and crucial First Tim had the advantage of Wallenstein s example Tim got to see where folly led great men Second Tim was fundamentally a realist for all his double domed educated flow of twaddle Tim had entered the world with a wary eye a keen sense of what benefited him and what worked to his disadvantage At the moment of Kirsten s death he had cannily destroyed part of her suicide note no fool he and he had been able amazingly to conceal their relationship from the media and from the Episcopal Church itself it all came out later of course but by then Tim was dead and probably did not care How an essentially pragmatic even it could be argued opportunistic man could involve himself in so much selfdefeating nonsense is of course amazing but even the nonsense had a sort of utility in the larger economy of Tim s life Tim did not wish to be bound by the formal strictures of his role he did not really define himself as a bishop any more than he had previously let himself be defined as an attorney He was a man and he thought of himself that way not a man in the sense of male person but man in the sense of human being who lived in many areas and spread out into a variety of vectors In his college days he had learned much from his study of the Renaissance once he had told me that in no way had the Renaissance overthrown or abolished the Medieval world the Renaissance had fulfilled it whatever T S Eliot might imagine to the contrary Take for example Tim had said to me Dante s Commedia Clearly in terms of brute date of composition the Commedia emanated from the Middle Ages it summed up the Medieval worldview absolutely its greatest crown And yet although many critics will not agree the Commedia has a vast span of vision that in no way can be bipolarized to say the view of Michelangelo who in fact drew heavily on the Commedia for his Sistine Chapel ceiling Tim saw Christianity reaching its climax in the Renaissance he did not view that moment in history as the ancient world revived and overpowering the Middle Ages the Christian Ages the Renaissance was not the triumph of the old pagan world over faith but rather the final and fullest flowering of faith specifically the Christian faith therefore Tim reasoned the well known Renaissance man who knew something about everything who was to use the correct term a polymath was the ideal Christian at home in this world and in the next a perfect blend of matter and spirit matter divinized as it were Matter transformed but still matter The two realms this and the next brought back together as they had been joined before the Fall This ideal Tim intended to capture for himself to make it his own The complete person he reasoned does not lock himself into his job no matter how exalted that job A cobbler who views himself only as one who repairs shoes is circumscribing himself viciously a bishop by the same reasoning must therefore enter regions occupied by the whole man One of these regions consisted of that of sexuality Although the general opinion ran contrary to this Tim did not care nor did he yield He knew what was apt for the Renaissance man and he knew that he himself constituted that man in all his authenticity That this trying out of every possible idea to see if it would fit finally destroyed Tim Archer can t be disputed He tried out too many ideas picked them up examined them used them for a while and then discarded them some of the ideas however as if possessing a life of their own came back around the far side of the barn and got him That is history this is an historical fact Tim is dead The ideas did not work They got him off the ground and then betrayed him and attacked him they dumped him in a sense before he could dump them One thing however could not be obscured Tim Archer could tell when he was locked in a life and death struggle and upon perceiving this he assumed the posture of grim defense He did not just as he had said to me the day Kirsten died surrender Fate to get Tim Archer would have to run him through Tim would never run himself through He would not collude with retributive fate once he spotted it and what it was up to He had done that now discerned retributive fate seeking him He neither fled nor cooperated He stood and fought and in that stance died But he died hard which is to say he died hitting back Fate had to murder him And while fate figured out how to accomplish this Tim s quick brain was totally engaged in sidestepping through every mental gymnastic move possible that which perhaps held in it the force of the inevitable This is probably what we mean by the term fate were it not inevitable we would not employ that term we would instead speak of bad luck We would talk about accidents With fate there is no accident there is intent And there is relentless intent closing in from all directions at once as if the person s very universe is shrinking Finally it holds nothing but him and his sinister destiny He is programmed against his will to succumb and in his efforts to thrash himself free he succumbs even faster from fatigue and despair Fate wins then no matter what A lot of this Tim himself told me He had studied up on the topic as part of his Christian education The ancient world had seen the coming into existence of the Greco Roman Mystery Religions which were dedicated to overcoming fate by patching the worshipper into a god beyond the planetary spheres a god capable of short circuiting the astral influences as it had been called in those days We ourselves now speak of the DNA death strip and the psychological script learned from modeled on other previous people friends and parents It is the same thing it is determinism killing you no matter what you do Some power outside of you must enter and alter the situation you cannot do it for yourself for the programming causes you to perform the act that will destroy you the act is performed with the idea that it will save you whereas in point of fact it delivers you over to the very doom you wish to evade Tim knew all this It didn t help him But he did his best he tried Practical men do not do what Jeff did and Kirsten did practical men fight that drift because it is a romantic drift a weakness It is learned passivity it is learned giving up Tim could ignore his son s death as unique reasoning that no contagion was involved but when Kirsten went the same way Tim had to change his mind return to Jeff s death and reappraise it He saw in it now the origins of later disaster and he saw that disaster shaping up for himself This caused him immediately to jettison all the claptrap notions that he had picked up beginning with Jeff s death all the weird and shabby ideas associated with the occult to borrow Menotti s apt phrase Tim suddenly realized that he had seated himself at the table in Mme Flora s parlor for the purpose of contacting the spirits for the purpose really of delivering himself over to folly He now did what characterized him throughout his life he abandoned that route and sought another he dumped that malicious cargo and reached around for something more stable more durable and sound to replace it If the ship is to be saved cargo must sometimes be flung overboard when something is jettisoned it is dumped calculatedly heaved away to float off leaving the ship intact This moment only comes when the ship is in trouble as Tim now was Dr Garret had pronounced doom on both himself and Kirsten beginning with Kirsten The first prophecy had come true He could expect then to be next These are emergency procedures They are employed by the desperate and the smart Tim was both And out of necessity Tim knew the difference between the ship which was not expendable and the cargo which was He viewed himself as the ship He viewed his faith in spirits in his son s return from the next world as cargo This clear distinction was his advantage inasmuch as he could discern it Throwing away his beliefs did not compromise him nor did it vitiate him And there existed a slight chance that it might save him I rejoiced in Tim s newfound lucidity But I felt deeply pessimistic I viewed his clearheadedness as a surfacing of his basic determination to survive This is a good thing You cannot fault the drive to endure The only question that frightened me was had it come soon enough Time would tell When the ship is saved if it is saved necessary jettison gives the right of general salvage to the owner or owners of the goods This is an international rule of the seas This is an idea basic to human beings of whatever place of origin Tim consciously or unconsciously understood this In doing what he was doing he partook of something venerable and universally accepted I understood him I think anybody would This was not the time to whine over lost battles involving the issue of whether or not his son had returned from the next world this was the time for Tim to fight for his life He did so and he did the very best he could I watched and where possible I helped It failed in the end but not for want of effort not for a failure of trying a decline of nerve This is not expedience This is rousing oneself to a final defense To view Tim in his final days as a cheap man devoted to animal survival at all costs abandoning all moral conviction is to misunderstand totally when your life is at stake you act in certain ways if you are smart and Tim acted in those ways he dumped everything that could be dumped should have been dumped he bared his dog tooth and offered to bite and that is what a man does in the sense of man the creature who is determined to survive and to hell with the cargo Upon Kirsten s death Tim stood in danger of imminent death himself and he understood it and for you to understand him in that final period you must take his realization into consideration and you must also understand that his perception his realization was correct He was as the therapists put it in touch with the reality situation as if there is some kind of distinction between situation and reality situation He desired to live So do I Presumably so do you Then you should be able to figure out what Bishop Archer had in mind during the period following Kirsten s death and preceding his own the first a given the second an ominous but dubitable possibility not a reality not then at least although from our standpoint now as hindsight we can comprehend it as inevitable But this is the famous nature of hindsight to it everything is inevitable since everything has already happened Even if Tim regarded his own death as inevitable willed by prophecy willed by the sibyl or by Apollo speaking through the sibyl as a mouthpiece he was determined to confront that fate and put up the best fight he could manage I think that is quite remarkable and to be lauded That he jettisoned a whole lot of claptrap that he once believed in and preached is of no importance should he have hugged all that crap and died in a curled up abreactive posture his eyes shut his dog tooth not bared I am of firm conviction in this I saw it I fathomed it I saw the cargo go I saw it heaved overboard the instant Dr Garret s first prophecy came true And I said Thank God I think though he should have withdrawn that goddamn book from publication that Here Tyrant Death as I had titled it But he did have thirty thousand dollars riding on it and perhaps this determination to let it get into print was simply further evidence of his practicality I don't know Some aspects of Tim Archer remain a mystery to me even to this day It simply was not Tim s style to abort a mistake before it happened he let it happen and then as he put it he filed a correction in the form of an amendment Except insofar as his physical survival was involved there he calculated activity in advance There he looked ahead The man who had run through his own life outpacing himself outdistancing himself as if urged on by the amphetamines he daily swallowed that man now all at once ceased to run turned instead gazed at fate and said as Luther is supposed to have said but did not Here I stand I can do not otherwise Hier step Ich Ich kann nicht anders The German ontologist Martin Heidegger has a term for that the transmutation of inauthentic Being to true Being or Sein I studied that at Cal I didn t think I would ever see it happen but it did and I did And I found it beautiful but very sad because it failed Within my mind I conceived of the spirit of my dead husband penetrating my thoughts and being highly amused Jeff would have pointed out to me that I viewed the bishop as a cargo ship a freighter baring its dog tooth a mixed metaphor which would have kept Jeff in a state of rapture for days I would never have heard the end of it My mind had begun to go due to Kirsten s suicide at work comparing the content of shipments to the listings on the invoices I barely noticed what I did I had withdrawn My fellow workers and my boss pointed this out to me And I ate little I spent my lunch hour reading Delmore Schwartz who I am told died with his head in a sack of garbage that he had been carrying downstairs when he suffered his fatal heart attack A great way for a poet to go The problem with introspection is that it has no end like Bottom s dream in A Midsummer Night s Dream it has no bottom From my years at Cal in the English Department I had learned to make up metaphors play around with them mix them serve them up I am a metaphor junkie overeducated and smart I think too much read too much worry about those I love too much Those I loved had begun to die Not many remained here most had gone They are all gone into the world of light And I alone sit lingring here Their very memory is far and bright And my sad thoughts doth clear As Henry Vaughan wrote in The poem ends Either disperse these mists which blot and fill My perspective still as they pass Or else remove me hence unto that hill Where I shall need no glass By glass Vaughan means a telescope I looked it up The seventeenth century minor metaphysical poets constituted my specialty during my school years Now after Kirsten s death I turned back to them because my thoughts had turned like theirs to the next world My husband had gone there my best friend had gone there I expected Tim to go there soon and thus he did Unfortunately I began now to see less of Tim This for me acted as the worst strike of all I really loved him but now the ties had been severed They got severed from his end He resigned as Bishop of the Diocese of California and moved down to Santa Barbara and the think tank there his book which in my eternal opinion should have been suppressed had come out to indict him as a fool this combined with the scandal about Kirsten the media despite Tim s tampering with evidence had caught on to their secret relationship Tim s career with the Episcopal Church ended suddenly he packed up and left San Francisco surfacing in as he had put it the private sector There he could relax and be happy there he could live his life without the repressive strictures of Christian canon law and morality I missed him A third element had blended in to terminate his relationship with the Episcopal Church and that of course consisted of the goddamn Zadokite Documents which Tim simply could not leave alone No longer involved with Kirsten she being dead and no longer involved with the occult since he recognized that for what it was he now concentrated all his credulity on the writings of that ancient Hebrew sect declaring as he did in speeches and in interviews and articles that here indeed lay the true origins of the teachings of Jesus Tim could not leave trouble behind him He and trouble were destined to join company I kept abreast of developments concerning Tim by reading magazines and newspapers my contact came secondhand I no longer had direct personal knowledge of him For me this constituted tragedy more perhaps than losing Jeff and Kirsten although I never told anyone that even my therapists I lost track too of Bill Lundborg he drifted out of my life and into a mental hospital and that was that I tried to track him down but failing gave up I was either batting zero or a thousand whichever way you want to compute it Whichever way you want to compute it the results came out to this I had lost everyone I knew so the time had arrived to make new friends I decided that retail record selling was more than a job for me it amounted to a vocation Within a year I had risen to the post of manager of the Musik Shop I had unlimited powers to buy the owners put no ceiling on me none at all My judgment alone determined what I ordered or did not order and all the salesmen the representatives of the various labels knew it That earned me a lot of free lunches and some interesting dates I started coming out of my shell seeing people more I wound up with a boyfriend if you can abide such an old fashioned term it would never be employed in Berkeley Lover I guess is the word I want I let Hampton move into my house with me the house Jeff and I had bought and began what I hoped was a fresh new life in terms of my involvements Tim s book Here Tyrant Death did not sell as well as had been expected I saw remaindered copies at the different bookstores near Sather Gate It had cost too much and rambled on too long he would have done better to shorten it insofar as he had written it most of it when I finally got around to reading it struck me as Kirsten s work at least she had done the final draft no doubt based on Tim s bang bang dictation That was what she had told me and probably it was the case He never followed it up with an amending sequel as he had promised me One Sunday morning as I sat with Hampton in our living room smoking a joint of the new seedless grass and watching the kids cartoons on TV I got a phone call unexpectedlyfrom Tim Hi Angel he said in that hearty warm voice of his I hope this isn t a bad time to call you It s fine I managed to say wondering if I really heard Tim s voice or if due to the grass I was hallucinating it How are you I ve been The reason I'm calling Tim interrupted as if I had not been speaking as if he did not hear me is that I ll be in Berkeley next week I'm attending a conference at the Claremont Hotel and I d like to get together with you Great I said immensely pleased Can we get together for dinner You know the restaurants in Berkeley better than I do I ll let you pick whichever one you like He chuckled It ll be wonderful to see you again Like old times I asked him haltingly how he had been Everything down here is going fine Tim said I'm extremely busy I ll be flying to Israel next month I wanted to talk to you about that Oh I said That sounds like a lot of fun I'm going to visit the wadi Tim said Where the Zadokite Documents were found They ve all been translated now Some of the final fragments proved extremely interesting But I ll tell you about that when I see you Yes I said warming to the topic as always Tim s enthusiasm was contagious I read a long article in Scientific American some of the last fragments I ll pick you up Wednesday night Tim said At your house Be formally dressed if you would You remember Oh of course I remember where your house is It seemed to me he was speaking ultra rapidly Or had the grass affected me No the grass would slow things down I said in panic I'm working at the store on Wednesday night As if he hadn t heard me Tim said About eight o clock I ll see you then Good bye dear Click He had rung off Shit I said to myself I'm working until nine Wednesday night Well I will just have to get one of the clerks to fill in for me I am not going to miss having dinner with Tim before he leaves for Israel I wondered then how long he would be over there Probably for some time He had gone once before and planted a cedar tree I remembered that the news media had made quite a bit of it Who was that Hampton said seated in jeans and a T shirt before the TV set my tall thin acerbic boyfriend with his black wire hair and his glasses My father in law I said Former father in law Jeff s father Hampton said nodding A crooked grin appeared on his face I have an idea as to what to do with people who suicide I think it should be a law that when they find someone who s suicided they should dress him up in a clown suit And photograph him that way And print his picture in the newspaper like that in the clown suit Such as Sylvia Plath Especially Sylvia Plath Hampton went on then to recount how Plath and her girlfriends according to Hampton s imagination used to play games in which they d see who could stick their head in the oven of the kitchen stove the longest meanwhile all of them going tee hee giggling and breaking up you're not funny I said and walked from the room into the kitchen Hampton called after me you're not sticking your head in the oven are you Go fuck yourself I said with a big red rubber bulb for a nose Hampton was droning on mostly to himself his voice and the racket of the TV set the kids cartoons assailed me I put my hands over my ears to shut out the noise Head out of the oven Hampton yelled I walked back into the living room and shut off the TV set turning to face Hampton I said Those two people were in a lot of pain There s nothing funny about someone who s in that much pain Grinning Hampton rocked back and forth seated curled up on the floor And big floppy hands he said Clown hands I opened the front door I ll see you I'm going for a walk I shut the door after me The front door swung open Hampton came out on the porch cupped his hands to his mouth and called Tee hee I'm going to stick my head in the oven Let s see if the baby sitter gets here in time Do you think she ll get here in time Anybody want to make a bet I did not look back I kept on going As I walked along I thought about Tim and I thought about Israel and what it must be like there the hot climate the desert and the rock the kibbutzim Tilling the soil the ancient soil that had been worked for thousands of years farmed by Jews long before the time of Christ Maybe they would direct Tim s attention to the ground I thought And away from the next world Back to the real back to where it belonged I doubted it but perhaps I was wrong I wished then that I could go with Tim quit my job at the record store just take off and go Maybe never return Stay in Israel forever Become a citizen Convert to Judaism If they d have me Tim could probably swing it Maybe in Israel I d stop mixing metaphors and remembering poems Maybe my mind would give up trying to solve problems in terms of recycled words Used phrases bits ripped from here and there fragments from my days at Cal in which I had memorized but not understood understood but not applied applied but never successfully A spectator to the destruction of my friends I said to myself one who records on a notepad the names of those who die and did not manage to save any of them not even one I will ask Tim if I can go with him I decided Tim will say no he has to say no but nonetheless I will ask To root Tim in reality I realized they will first have to get his attention and if he is still on the Dex it will not be possible for them to do that his mind will be tripping and freewheeling and spinning forever out into the void conceiving the great models of the heavens they will try and like me they will fail If I go with him maybe I can help I thought the Israelis and I maybe could do what I never could do alone I will direct their attention to him and they in turn will direct his attention to the soil under their feet Christ I thought I have to go with him It s essential Because they will not have time to notice the problem He will skim his way across their country be first here then there never lighting never coming to rest long enough never letting them A car honked at me I had wandered out onto the street crossing unconsciously without looking Sorry I said to the driver who glared at me I am no better than Tim I realized I d be no help in Israel But even so I thought I wish I could go ON WEDNESDAY NIGHT Tim picked me up in a rented Pontiac I wore a black strapless gown and carried a little beaded purse I wore a flower in my hair and Tim gazing at me as he held the car door open remarked that I looked lovely Thank you I said feeling shy We drove to the restaurant on University Avenue just off Shattuck a Chinese restaurant that had recently opened I had never been there but customers at the Musik Shop had told me it was the great new place to eat in town Have you always worn your hair up like that Tim asked as the hostess led us to our table I got it done for tonight I explained I showed him my earrings Jeff got me these years ago I usually don't wear them I'm afraid I ll lose one You ve lost a little weight He held my chair for me and I nervously seated myself It s the work Ordering far into the night How is the law firm I said I manage a record store Yes Tim said You got me that album of Fidelio I haven t had much chance to play it He opened his menu then absorbed he turned his attention away from me How easily that attention waned I thought Or rather alters its focal point It isn t the attention that changes it is the object of that attention He must live in an endlessly shifting world Heraclitus flux world personified It pleased me to see that Tim still wore his clericals Is that legal I asked myself Well it s none of my business I picked up my menu This was Mandarin style Chinese food not Cantonese it would be spiced and hot not sweet with lots of nuts Ginger root I said to myself I felt hungry and happy and very glad to be back with my friend again Angel Tim said come with me to Israel Staring at him I said What As my secretary Still staring I said Take Kirsten s place you mean I began then to tremble A waiter came over I waved him away Would either of you like a drink the waiter said ignoring my gesture Go away I said to him with menace in my voice The goddamn waiter I said to Tim What are you talking about I mean what sort of Just as my secretary I don't mean any personal involvement nothing of that sort Did you think I was asking you to become my mistress I need someone to do the job Kirsten did I find I can t manage without her Christ I said I thought you meant as your mistress That s out of the question Tim said in the stern firm tone that meant he was not joking That in fact he disapproved I think of you still as my daughter in law I run the record store I said My budget permits a fairly good outlay I can probably pay you as well as your law office He corrected himself As the record store pays Let me think about it I beckoned to the waiter to come over A martini I said to him Extra dry Nothing for the bishop Tim smiled wryly I'm no longer a bishop I can t I said Come to Israel I have too many ties here In a quiet voice Tim said If you don't come with me I will never He broke off I saw Dr Garret again Recently Jeff came across from the next world He says that unless I take you to Israel with me I ll die there That is pure nonsense I said Pure absolute bilge I thought you gave all that up There have been more phenomena He did not elaborate his face I saw looked strained and pale Reaching I took Tim s hand don't talk to Garret Talk to me I say Go to Israel and the hell with that old lady It isn t Jeff it s her You know that The clocks Tim said They ve been stopped at the time Kirsten died Even so I began I think it may be both of them Tim said Go to Israel I said Talk to the people there to the people of Israel If ever any people was embedded in reality I won t have much time I ve got to get right to the Dead Sea Desert and find the wadi I have to be back in time to meet with Buckminster Fuller I think it s Buckminster I'm supposed to meet with He touched his coat It s written down His voice trailed off It was my impression that Buckminster Fuller is dead I said No I'm sure you're wrong He gazed at me I gazed back and then by degrees we both began to laugh See I said still holding the bishop s hand in mine I wouldn t be any help to you They say you would Tim said Jeff and Kirsten Tim I said think of Wallenstein I have a choice Tim said in a low but clear voice a voice of brisk authority between believing the impossible and the stupid on the one hand and He ceased speaking And not believing I said Wallenstein was murdered Tim said No one will murder you I am afraid Tim said Tim I said the worst thing is the occult crap I know Believe me That s what killed Kirsten You realized that when she died remember You can t go back to that stuff You will lose all the ground Better a live dog Tim grated than a dead lion By that I mean Better to believe in nonsense than to be realistic and skeptical and scientific and rational and die in Israel Then simply don't go What I need to know is there at the wadi What I need to find The anokhi Angel the mushroom It s there somewhere and that mushroom is Christ The real Christ whom Jesus spoke for Jesus was the messenger of the anokhi which is the true holy power the true source I want to see it I want to find it It grows in the caves I know it does I said It once did It is there now Christ is there now Christ has the power to break the hold of fate The only way I'm going to survive is if someone breaks the hold of fate and releases me otherwise I will follow Jeff and Kirsten That s what Christ does he unseats the ancient planetary powers Paul mentions that in his Captivity Letters Christ rises from sphere to sphere Again his voice trailed off bleakly you're talking about magic I'm talking about God God is everywhere God is at the wadi The Parousia the Divine Presence It was there for the Zadokites it is there now The power of fate is in essence the power of world and only God expressed as Christ can burst the power of world It s inscribed in the Book of the Spinners that I will die except that Christ s blood and body save me He explained The Zadokite Documents speak of a book in which the future of every human is written from before Creation The Book of the Spinners it s something like Torah The Spinners are fate personified like the Norns in Germanic mythology They weave men s fortunes Christ alone acting for God here on Earth seizes the Book of the Spinners reads it carries the information to the person informs him of his fate and then through his absolute wisdom Christ instructs the person on the way his fate can be avoided The road out He was silent then We d better order There are people waiting I said Prometheus stealing fire for man the secret of fire Christ seizing the Book of the Spinners reading it and then carrying the information to man to save him Yes Tim nodded It s roughly the same myth Except that this is no myth Christ really exists As a spirit there at the wadi I can t go with you I said and I'm sorry You ll have to go by yourself and then you ll see that Dr Garret is pandering to your fears the way she pandered to and viciously exploited Kirsten s fears You could drive me There are drivers there in Israel who know the desert I don't know anything about the Dead Sea Desert You have an excellent sense of direction I get lost I am lost I'm lost now I wish I could go with you but I have my job and my life and my friends I don't want to leave Berkeley it s my home I'm sorry but that s God s truth Berkeley is where I ve always lived I'm just not ready to leave it at this time Maybe later My martini came I drank it down all at once in a spasmodic gulp that left me panting Tim said The anokhi is the pure consciousness of God It is therefore Hagia Sophia God s Wisdom Only that wisdom which is absolute can read the Book of the Spinners It can t change what is written but it can discern a way to outwit the Book The writing is fixed it will never change He seemed defeated now he had begun to give up I need that wisdom Angel Nothing less will do You are like Satan I said and then realized that the gin had hit me in a rush I had not meant to say that No Tim said and then he nodded Yes I am you're right I'm sorry I said that I said I don't want to be killed off like an animal If the writing can be read then an answer can be figured out Christ has the power to figure it out Hagia Sophia Christ They re homologized from the Old Testament hypostasis to the New But I could see he had given up he could not budge me and he knew it Why not Angel he said Why won t you come Because I said I don't want to die there in the Dead Sea Desert All right I ll go alone Someone should survive all this I said Tim nodded I would want you to survive Angel So stay here I apologize for Just forgive me I said He smiled wanly You could ride on a camel They smell bad I said Or so I ve heard If I find the anokhi I will have access to God s wisdom After it has been absent from the world for over two thousand years That is what the Zadokite Documents speak of that wisdom that we once had open to us Think what it would mean The waiter approached our table and asked us if we were ready to order I said I was Tim glanced about him in confusion as if just now aware of his surroundings It made my heart ache to see his bewilderment But I had made up my mind My life as it was constituted meant too much for me most of all I feared involvement with this man it had cost Kirsten her life and in a subtle way my husband s I wanted that all behind me I had started over I no longer looked back Wanly without enthusiasm Tim told the waiter what to bring him he seemed oblivious of me now as if I had faded into the surroundings I turned to my own menu and saw there what I wanted What I wanted was immediate fixed real tangible it lay in this world and it could be touched and grasped it had to do with my house and my job and it had to do with banishing ideas finally from my mind ideas about other ideas an infinite regress of them spiraling off forever The food when the waiter brought it tasted wonderful Both Tim and I ate with pleasure My customers had been right Mad at me I said after we had finished No Happy because you will survive this And you will stay as you are He pointed at me then with a commanding expression on his face But if I find what I am after I will change I will not be as I am I have read all the documents and the answer isn t in them the documents point to the answer and they point to the location of the answer but the answer is not in them It is at the wadi I am taking a risk but it s worth it I am willing to take the risk because I may find the anokhi and just knowing that makes it worth it I said suddenly with insight There haven t been any more phenomena True And you didn t go back to Dr Garret True He did not seem contrite or embarrassed That was to get me to come with you I want you along So you can drive me Otherwise I'm afraid I won t find what I'm looking for He smiled Shit I said I believed you I have had dreams Tim said Disturbing dreams But no pins under my fingernails No singed hair No stopped clocks I said falteringly You wanted me to come with you that badly For a moment I felt a surge in me a need to go You think it would be good for me too I said then Yes But you won t come That s clear Well He smiled his old familiar wise smile I tried Am I in a rut then Living in Berkeley Professional student Tim said I run a record store Your customers are students and faculty you're still tied to the university You haven t broken the cord Until you do you will not fully be an adult I was born the night I drank bourbon and read the Commedia When I had that abscessed tooth You began to be born You knew about birth But until you come to Israel that is where you will be born there in the Dead Sea Desert That is where the spiritual life of man began at Mt Sinai with Moses Ehyeh speaking the theophany The greatest moment in the history of man I would almost go I said Go then He reached out his hand I said simply I'm afraid That s the problem Tim said That s the heritage of the past Jeff s death and Kirsten s death That s what it s done to you done permanently Left you afraid to live Better a live dog But Tim said you are not genuinely alive You are still unborn This is what Jesus meant by the Second Birth the Birth in or from the Spirit the Birth from Above This is what lies in the desert This is what I will find Find it I said but find it without me He who loses his life don't quote the Bible to me I said I ve heard enough quotations my own and others Okay Tim reached out and we solemnly without speaking shook hands He smiled a little then after a bit he let my hand go and then examined his gold pocket watch I'm going to have to get you home I ve still got one appointment left this evening You understand you know me Yes I said It s okay Tim I said you are a master strategist I watched you when you met Kirsten You brought it all to bear on me here tonight And you almost persuaded me I said to myself In a few more minutes I would have given in If you had kept up just a little longer I am in the business of saving souls Tim said enigmatically I could not tell if he spoke in irony or if he meant it I simply could not tell Your soul is worth saving he said then as he rose to his feet I'm sorry to rush you but we do have to go You always were in a hurry I said to myself as I also got up It was a wonderful dinner I said Was it I didn t notice I'm preoccupied apparently I have so many things to finish before I fly to Israel Now that I don't have Kirsten to arrange everything for me she did such a good job You ll find someone I said Tim said I thought I found you The fisherman tonight I fished for you and didn t get you Some other time maybe No Tim said There will be no other time He did not amplify He did not have to I knew that it was so for one reason or another I sensed it Tim was right When Timothy Archer flew to Israel the NBC network news mentioned it briefly as they would mention a flight of birds a migration too regular to be important and yet something the viewers should be told about by way it would seem of a reminder that Episcopal Bishop Timothy Archer still existed and was still busy and active in the affairs of the world And then we the American public heard nothing for a week or so I got a card from him but the card arrived after the big news coverage the late breaking sensational story of Bishop Archer s abandoned Datsun found its rear end up off the little rutted winding road up on a jutting rock the gas station map still on the right hand front seat where he had left it The government of Israel did everything possible and did it swiftly they had troops and shit They employed everything they had but the news people knew that Tim Archer had died in the Dead Sea Desert because you cannot live out there crawling up cliffs and down into ravines you cannot survive and they did eventually find his body and it looked as if one of the reporters on the scene said as if he knelt praying But in fact Tim had fallen a long way down a cliff side And I drove as usual to the record store and opened it up for business and put money in the register and this time I did not cry Why hadn t he taken a professional driver the news people asked Why had he ventured out on the desert alone with a gas station map and two bottles of soda pop I knew the answer Because he was in a hurry Undoubtedly getting hold of a professional driver took in his view too much time He could not wait around As with me in the Chinese restaurant that night Tim had to get moving he could not stay in one place he was a busy man and he rushed on he rushed out into the desert in that little four cylinder car that isn t even safe on California freeways as Bill Lundborg had pointed out those subcompact cars are dangerous I loved him the most of all of them I knew it when I heard the news knew it in a different way than I had known it before before it had been a feeling an emotion But when I realized he was dead that knowledge made me into a sick person that limped and cringed but drove to work and filled the register and answered the phone and asked customers if I could help them I wasn t sick as a human is sick or an animal is sick I became ill like a machine I still moved but my soul died my soul that Tim had said had never been fully born that soul not yet born but born a little and wishing to be born more born fully that soul died and my body mechanically continued on The soul I lost during that week did not ever return I am a machine now years later a machine heard the news of John Lennon s death and a machine grieved and pondered and drove to Sausalito to sit in on Edgar Barefoot s seminar because that is what a machine does that is a machine s way of greeting the horrible A machine doesn t know any better it simply grinds along and maybe whirrs That is all it can do You cannot expect more than that from a machine That is all it has to offer That is why we speak of it as a machine it understands intellectually but there is no understanding in its heart because its heart is a mechanical one designed to act as a pump And so it pumps and so the machine limps and coasts on and knows but does not know And keeps up its routine It lives out what it supposes to be life it maintains its schedule and obeys the laws It does not drive its car over the speed limit on the Richardson Bridge and it says to itself I never liked the Beatles I found them insipid Jeff brought home Rubber Soul and if I hear it repeats to itself what it has thought and heard the simulation of life Life it once possessed and now has lost a life now gone It knows it knows not what as the philosophy books say about a confused philosopher I forget which one Locke maybe And Locke believes he knows not what That impressed me that turn of phrase I look for that I am attracted to clever phrases which are to be regarded as good English prose style I am a professional student and will remain one I will not change My opportunity to change was offered to me and I turned it down I am stuck now and as I say know but know not what FACING US SMILING a moon wide smile Edgar Barefoot said What if a symphony orchestra was intent only on reaching the final coda What would become of the music One great crash of sound over as soon as possible The music is in the process the unfolding if you hasten it you destroy it Then the music is over I want you to think about that Okay I said to myself I ll think about it There is nothing on this particular day I d prefer to think about Something has happened something important but I do not wish to remember it No one does I can see it around me this same reaction My reaction in the others here on this cushy houseboat at Gate Five Where you pay a hundred dollars the same sum I believe that Tim and Kirsten paid that crank that quack psychic and medium down in Santa Barbara who wrecked us all One hundred dollars appears to be the magic sum it opens the door to enlightenment Which is why I am here My life is devoted to seeking enlightenment as are the other lives around me This is the noise of the Bay Area the racket and din of meaning this is what we exist for to learn Teach us Barefoot I said to myself Tell me something I don't know I being deficient of comprehension yearn to know You can begin with me I am the most attentive of your pupils I trust everything you utter I am the perfect fool come here to take Give Keep on with the sounds it lulls me and I forget Young lady Barefoot said With a start I realized he was speaking to me Yes I said rousing myself What s your name Barefoot asked Angel Archer I said Why are you here To get away I said From what Everything I said Why It hurts I said John Lennon you mean Yes I said And more Other things I was noticing you Barefoot said because you were asleep You may not have realized it Did you realize it I realized it I said Is that how you want me to perceive you As asleep Let me alone I said Let you sleep then Yes I said The sound of one hand clapping Barefoot quoted I said nothing Do you want me to hit you Cuff you To wake you up I don't care I said It doesn t matter to me What would it take to awaken you Barefoot said I did not answer My job is to wake people You are another fisherman Yes I fish for fish Not for souls I do not know of soul I only know of fish A fisherman fishes for fish if he thinks he fishes for anything else he is a fool he deludes himself and those he fishes for Fish for me then I said What do you want Not ever to wake up Then come up here Barefoot said Come up and stand beside me I will teach you how to sleep It is as hard to sleep as it is to wake up You sleep poorly without skill I can teach you that as easily as I can teach you to wake up Whatever you want you can have Are you sure you know what you want Maybe you secretly want to wake up You may be wrong about yourself Come on up here He reached out his hand don't touch me I said as I walked toward him I don't want to be touched So you know that I am sure of that I said Maybe what is wrong with you is that no one has ever touched you Barefoot said You tell me I said I have nothing to say Whatever I had to say You have never said anything Barefoot said You have been silent all your life Only your mouth has talked If you say so Tell me your name again Angel Archer Do you have a secret name That no one knows I have no secret name I said And then I said I am traitor Who did you betray Friends I said Well Traitor Barefoot said talk to me about your bringing your friends to ruin How did you do it With words I said Like now You are good with words Very good I said I am a sickness a word sickness I was taught it by professionals I have no words Barefoot said Okay I said Then I will listen Now you begin to know I nodded Do you have any pets at home Barefoot said Any dogs or cats An animal Two cats I said Do you groom them and feed them and care for them Are you responsible for them Do you take them to the vet when they re ill Sure I said Who does all that for you For me I said No one Can you do it for yourself Yes I can I said Then Angel Archer you are alive Not intentionally I said But you are You don't think so but you are Under the words the disease of words you are alive I am trying to tell you this without using words but it is impossible All we have is words Sit down again and listen Everything I say from now on today is directed at you I am speaking to you but not with words Does that make any sense to you No I said Then just sit down Barefoot said I reseated myself Angel Archer Barefoot said You are wrong about yourself You are not sick you are starved What is killing you is hunger Words have nothing to do with it You have been starved all your life Spiritual things will not help You don't need them There are too many spiritual things in the world far too many You are a fool Angel Archer but not a good kind of fool I said nothing You need real meat Barefoot said and real drink not spiritual meat and drink I offer you real food for your body so it will grow You are a starving person who has come here to be fed but without knowing it You have no idea why you came here today it is my job to tell you When people come here to listen to me speak I offer them a sandwich The foolish ones listen to my words the wise ones eat the sandwich This is not an absurdity that I tell you it is the truth This is something none of you has imagined but I give you real food and that food is a sandwich the words the talking is only wind is nothing I charge you one hundred dollars but you learn something priceless When your dog or cat is hungry do you talk to him No you give him food I give you food but you do not know it You have everything backward because the university has taught you that it has taught you wrong It has lied to you And now you tell yourselves lies you have learned how to do it and you do it very well Take the sandwich and eat forget about the words The only purpose in the words was to lure you here Strange I thought He means it Some of my unhappiness began then to ebb away I felt a peacefulness come over me a loss of suffering Someone from behind me leaned forward and touched me on the shoulder Hi Angel I turned around to see who it was A pudgy faced youth blond haired smiling at me his eyes guileless Bill Lundborg wearing a turtleneck sweater and gray slacks and I saw to my surprise Hush Puppies Remember me he said softly I'm sorry I didn t answer any of your letters I ve been wondering how you ve been doing Fine I said Just fine I guess we better be quiet He leaned back and folded his arms intent on what Edgar Barefoot was saying At the end of his lecture Barefoot walked over to me I still sat unmoving Bending Barefoot said Are you related to Bishop Archer Yes I said I was his daughter in law We knew each other Barefoot said Tim and I For years It was such a shock his death We used to discuss theology Coming up beside us Bill Lundborg stood listening saying nothing he still smiled the same old smile I remembered And then John Lennon s death today Barefoot said I hope I didn t embarrass you bringing you up front like that But I could see something was wrong You look better now I said I feel better Do you want a sandwich Barefoot indicated the people gathered around the table at the rear of the room No I said Barefoot said Then you weren t listening To what I told you I wasn t joking Angel you can t live on words words do not feed Jesus said Man does not live by bread alone I say Man does not live by words at all Have a sandwich Have something to eat Angel Bill Lundborg said I don't feel like eating I said I'm sorry I thought I d rather be left alone Bending down Bill said You look so thin My work I said remotely Angel Edgar Barefoot said this is Bill Lundborg We know each other Bill said We re old friends Then you know Barefoot said to me that Bill is a bodhisattva I didn t know that I said Barefoot said Do you know what a bodhisattva is Angel It has something to do with the Buddha I said The bodhisattva is one who has turned down his chance to attain Nirvana in order to turn back to help others Barefoot said For the bodhisattva compassion is as important a goal as wisdom That is the essential realization of the bodhisattva That s fine I said I get a lot out of what Edgar teaches Bill said to me Come on He took me by the hand I'm going to see that you eat something Do you consider yourself a bodhisattva I said to him No Bill said Sometimes the bodhisattva does not know Barefoot said It is possible to be enlightened without knowing it Also it is possible to think you are enlightened and yet not be The Buddha is called the Awakened One because awakened means the same as enlightened We all sleep but do not know it We live in a dream we walk and move and have our lives in a dream most of all we speak in a dream our speech is the speech of dreamers and unreal Like now I thought What I'm hearing Bill disappeared I looked around for him He s getting you something to eat Barefoot said This is all very strange I said This whole day has been unreal It is like a dream you're right They re playing all the old Beatles songs on every station Let me tell you something that happened to me once Barefoot said he seated himself in the chair beside me bent over his hands clasped together I was very young still in school I attended classes at Stanford but I did not graduate I took a lot of philosophy classes So did I I said One day I left my apartment to mail a letter I had been working on a paper not a paper to turn in but a paper of my own profound philosophical ideas ideas very important to me There was one particular problem I couldn t figure out it had to do with Kant and his ontological categories by which the human mind structures experience Time space and causation I said I know I studied that What I realized as I walked along Barefoot said was that in a very real sense I myself create the world that I experience I both make that world and perceive it As I walked the correct formulation of this came to me suddenly out of the blue One minute I didn t have it the next minute I did It was a solution I d been striving for over a period of years I had read Hume and then I had found the response to Hume s criticism of causation in Kant s writing now suddenly I had a response and a correctly worked out response to Kant I started hurrying Bill Lundborg reappeared he held a sandwich and a cup of fruit punch of some sort these he held out to me I accepted them reflexively Continuing Barefoot said I hurried back up the street toward my apartment as fast as I could go I had to get the satori down on paper before I forgot it What I had acquired there on that walk out of my apartment where I had no access to pen and paper was a comprehension of a world conceptually arranged a world not arranged in time and space and by causation but a world as idea conceived in a great mind the way our own minds store memories I had caught a glimpse of world not as my own arrangement by time space and causation but as it is in itself arranged Kant s thing in itself Which can t be known Kant said I said Which normally can t be known Barefoot said But I had somehow perceived it like a great reticulated arborizing structure of interrelationships everything organized according to meaning with all new events entering as accretions I had never before grasped the absolute nature of reality this way He paused a moment You got home and wrote it down I said No Barefoot said I never wrote it down As I hurried along I saw two tiny children one of them holding a baby bottle They were running back and forth across a street A lot of cars came along very fast I watched for a moment and then I went over to them I saw no adult I asked them to take me to their mother They didn t speak English it was a Spanish neighborhood very poor I didn t have any money in those days I found their mother She said I don't speak English and closed the door in my face She was smiling I remember that Smiling at me beatifically She thought I was a salesman I wanted to tell her that her children would very soon be killed and she shut the door in my face smiling angelically at me So what did you do Bill said Barefoot said I sat down on the curb and watched the two children For the rest of the afternoon Until their father came home He spoke a little English I was able to get him to understand He thanked me You did the right thing I said So I never got my model of the universe down on paper Barefoot said I just have a dim memory of it Something like that fades It was a once in a lifetime satori Moksa it is called in India a sudden flash of absolute comprehension out of nowhere What James Joyce means by epiphanies arising from the trivial or without cause at all simply happening Total insight into world He was silent then I said What I hear you saying is that the life of a Mexican child is Which way would you have taken Barefoot said to me Would you have gone home and written down your philosophical idea your moksa Or would you have stayed with the children I would have called the police I said To have done that Barefoot said would have required you to go to a phone To do that you would have had to leave the children It s a nice story I said But I knew someone else who told nice stories He s dead Maybe Barefoot said he found what he went to Israel to find Found it before he died I very much doubt that I said I doubt it too Barefoot said On the other hand maybe he found something better Something he should have been looking for but wasn t What I am trying to tell you is that all of us are unknowing bodhisattvas unwilling even unintentional It is something forced on us by chance circumstance All I wanted to do that day was rush home and get my great insight down on paper before I forgot it It really was a great insight I have no doubt of that I did not want to be a bodhisattva I did not ask to be I did not expect to be In those days I hadn t even heard the term Anyone would have done what I did Not anyone I said Most people would have I guess What would you have done Barefoot said Given that choice I said I guess I would have done what you did and hoped I d remember the insight But I did not remember it he said And that is the point Bill said to me then Can I hitch a ride with you back to the East Bay My car got towed off It threw a rod and I Sure I said I stood up stiffly my bones ached Mr Barefoot I ve listened to you on KPFA many times At first I thought you were stuffy but now I'm not so sure Before you go Barefoot said I want you to tell me how you betrayed your friends She didn t Bill said It s all in her mind Barefoot leaned toward me he put his arm around me and drew me back to my chair reseating me Well I said I let them die Especially Tim Tim could not have avoided death Barefoot said He went to Israel in order to die That s what he wanted Death was what he was looking for That s why I say Maybe he found what he was looking for or even something better Shocked I said Tim wasn t looking for death Tim put up the bravest fight against fate I ever saw anybody put up Death and fate are not the same Barefoot said He died to avoid fate because the fate he saw coming for him was worse than dying there on the Dead Sea Desert That s why he sought it and that s what he found but I think he found something better To Bill he said What do you think Bill I d rather not say Bill said But you know Barefoot said to him What was the fate you're talking about I asked Barefoot Barefoot said The same as yours The fate that has overtaken you And that you're aware of What is that I said Lost in meaningless words Barefoot said A merchant of words With no contact to life Tim had advanced far into that I read Here Tyrant Death several times It said nothing nothing at all Just words Flatus vocis an empty noise After a moment I said you're right I read it too How true it was how terribly sadly true And Tim realized it Barefoot said He told me He came to me a few months before his trip to Israel and told me He wanted me to teach him about the Sufis He wanted to exchange meaning all the meaning he d piled up in his lifetime for something else For beauty He told me about an album of records that you sold him that he never got a chance to play Beethoven s Fidelio He was always too busy Then you knew who I was already I said Before I told you That s why I asked you to come up front with me Barefoot said I recognized you Tim had shown me a picture of you and Jeff At first I wasn t sure you're a lot thinner now Well I have a demanding job I said Together Bill Lundborg and I drove back across the Richardson Bridge to the East Bay We listened to the radio to the endless procession of Beatles songs I knew you were trying to find me Bill said but my life wasn t going too well I ve finally been diagnosed as what they call hebephrenic To change the subject I said I hope the music isn t depressing you I can turn it off I like the Beatles Bill said Are you aware of John Lennon s death Sure Bill said Everybody is So you manage the Musik Shop now Yes indeed I said I have five clerks working under me and unlimited buying power I ve got an offer from Capitol Records to go down to the L A area to Burbank I guess and go to work for them I ve reached the top in terms of the retail record business managing a store is as far as you can go Except for owning the store And I don't have the money Do you know what hebephrenic means Yes I said I thought I even know the origin of the word Hebe was the Greek goddess of youth I said I never grew up Bill said Hebephrenia is characterized by silliness Guess so I said When you're hebephrenic Bill said things strike you as funny Kirsten s death struck me as funny Then you are indeed hebephrenic I said to myself as I drove Because there was nothing funny about it I said What about Tim s death Well parts of it were funny That little boxy car that Datsun And those two bottles of Coke Tim probably had shoes on like I have on now He lifted his foot to show me his Hush Puppies At least I said But by and large Bill said it was not funny What Tim was looking for wasn t funny Barefoot is wrong about what Tim was looking for he wasn t looking for death Not consciously I said but maybe unconsciously he was That s nonsense Bill said All that about unconscious motivation You can posit anything by reasoning that way You can attribute any motivation you want since there s no way it can be tested Tim was looking for that mushroom He sure picked a funny place to look for a mushroom a desert Mushrooms grow where it s moist and cool and shaded In caves I said There are caves there Yes well Bill said it wasn t actually a mushroom anyhow That too is a supposition A gratuitous assumption Tim stole that idea from a scholar named John Allegro Tim s problem was that he didn t really think for himself he picked up other people s ideas and believed they had come out of his own mind whereas in fact he stole them But the ideas had value I said and Tim synthesized them Tim brought various ideas together But not very good ones Glancing at Bill I said Who are you to judge I know you loved him Bill said You don't have to defend him all the time I'm not attacking him It sure sounds like it I loved him too A lot of people loved Bishop Archer He was a great man the greatest we ll ever know But he was a foolish man and you know that I said nothing I drove and I half listened to the radio They were now playing Yesterday Edgar was right about you however Bill said You should have dropped out of the university and not finished You learned too much With bitterness I said Learned too much Christ The vox populi Distrust of education I get sick and tired of hearing that shit I am glad of what I know It s wrecked you Bill said You can just go take a flying fling I said Bill said calmly You are very bitter and very unhappy You are a good person who loved Kirsten and Tim and Jeff and you haven t gotten over what happened to them And your education has not helped you cope with this There is no coping with this I said with fury They all were good people and they are all dead Your fathers ate manna in the desert and they are all dead What s that Jesus says that I think it s said during Mass I attended Mass a few times with Kirsten at Grace Cathedral One time when Tim was passing the chalice around Kirsten was kneeling at the rail he secretly slipped a ring around her finger No one saw but she told me It was a symbolic wedding ring Tim had on all his robes then Tell me about it I said bitterly I am telling you about it Did you know I knew about the ring I said She told me She showed it to me They considered themselves spiritually married Before and in the eyes of God Although not according to civil law Your fathers ate manna in the desert and they are all dead That refers to the Old Testament Jesus brings Oh my good God I said I thought I d heard the last of all this stuff I don't want ever to hear any more It didn t do any good then and it won t ever do any good Barefoot talks about useless words those are useless words Why would Barefoot call you a bodhisattva What is all this compassion and wisdom you have You attained Nirvana and came back to help others is that it I could have attained Nirvana Bill said But I turned it down To return Forgive me I said with weariness I don't understand what you're talking about Okay Bill said I came back to this world From the next world Out of compassion That is what I learned out there in the desert the Dead Sea Desert His voice was calm his face showed a deep calm That is what I found I stared at him I am Tim Archer Bill said I have come back from the other side To those I love He smiled a vast and secret smile AFTER A MOMENT of silence I said Did you tell Edgar Barefoot Yes Bill said Who else Almost no one else I said When did this happen And then I said You fucking lunatic It will never end it goes on and it goes on One by one they go mad and die All I want to do is Tun my record store and turn on and get laid now and then and read a few books I never asked for this My car s tires squealed as I swerved to pass a slow moving vehicle We had almost reached the Richmond end of the Richardson Bridge Angel Bill said He put his hand on my shoulder tenderly Get your goddamn hand off of me I said He withdrew his hand I have come back he said You have gone crazy again and belong back in the hospital you hebephrenic nut Can t you see what this is doing to me to have to listen to more of this You know what I thought about you I thought There in a certain real sense is the only sane one among us he is labeled as a nut but he is sane We are labeled as sane and we are nuts And now you You are the last one I would have expected this from but I guess I broke off Shit I said It s out of control this madness process I always said to myself Bill Lundborg is in touch with the real he thinks about cars You could have explained to Tim why one does not drive out on the Dead Sea Desert in a Datsun with two bottles of Coke and a gas station map And now you are as crazy as they were More crazy Reaching I turned up the radio the sound of the Beatles filled the car Bill at once shut the radio off entirely off Please slow down Bill said Please I said when we get to the toll gate get out of the car and hitch a Tide with somebody else And you can tell Edgar Barefoot to go stick his don't blame him Bill said sharply I only told him he didn t tell me Slow down He reached for the ignition key Okay I said putting my foot on the brake You will Toll this sardine can Bill said and kill us both And you don't even have your seat belt fastened On this day of all days I said The day they murder John Lennon I have to hear this right now I did not find the anokhi mushroom Bill said I said nothing I simply drove As best I could I fell Bill said From a cliff Yes I said I read that too in the Chronicle Did it hurt By that time I had become unconscious from the sunlight and the heat Well I said apparently you are just not a very bright person to go out there like that And then suddenly I felt compassion I felt shame overwhelming shame at what I was doing to him Bill I said forgive me Sure he said simply I thought through my words and then I said When did what am I supposed to call you Bill Or Tim Are you both now I'm both One personality has been formed out of the two Either name will do Probably you should call me Bill so that people won t know Why don't you want them to know I would think something as important and unique as this as momentous as this should be known Bill said They ll put me back in the hospital Then I said I will call you Bill About a month after his death Tim came back to me I didn t understand what was happening I couldn t figure it out Lights and colors and then an alien presence in my mind Another personality much smarter than me thinking all sorts of things I never thought And he knows Greek and Latin and Hebrew and all about theology He thought about you very clearly He had wanted to take you with him to Israel At that I glanced sharply at him and felt chilled That night at the Chinese restaurant Bill said he tried to talk you into it But you said you had your life all planned out You couldn t leave Berkeley Taking my foot from the gas pedal I allowed the car to slow down it moved more and more slowly until it came to a stop It s illegal to stop on the bridge Bill said Unless you're having motor trouble or run out of gas something of that sort Keep on driving Tim told him I said to myself Reflexively I down shifted into low I started the car up again Tim had a crush on you Bill said So I said That was one reason he wanted to take you to Israel with him I said You speak of Tim in the third person So in point of fact you do not identify yourself with Tim or as Tim you are Bill Lundborg talking about Tim I am Bill Lundborg he agreed But also I am Tim Archer Tim wouldn t tell me that I said about being sexually interested in me I know Bill said but I am telling you What did we have for dinner that night at the Chinese restaurant I have no idea Where was the restaurant In Berkeley Where in Berkeley I don't remember I said Tell me what hysteron proteron means How would I know that That s Latin Tim knows Latin I don't It s Greek I don't know any Greek I pick up Tim s thoughts and now and then he s thinking in Greek but I don't know what the Greek means What if I believe you I said What then Then Bill said you are happy because your old friend is not dead And that s the point of this He nodded Yes It would seem to me I said carefully there there would be a larger point involved This would be a miracle of staggering importance to the entire world It is something that scientists should investigate It proves there is eternal life that a next world does exist everything that Tim and Kirsten believed is in fact true Here Tyrant Death is true don't you agree Yes I suppose so That s what Tim is thinking he thinks that a lot He wants me to write a book but I can t write a book I don't have any writing talent You can act as Tim s secretary The way your mother did Tim can dictate and you can write it all down He rattles on and on a mile a minute I ve tried to write it down but his thinking is fucked If you ll pardon the expression It s all disorganized it goes everywhere and nowhere And I don't know half the words In fact a lot of it isn t words at all just impressions Can you hear him now No Not right now It s usually when I'm alone and no one else is talking Then I can sort of tune in on it Hysteron proteron I murmured When the thing to be demonstrated is included in the premise So it s all in vain the reasoning Bill I said I ve got to hand it to you you have me tied up in a knot you really have Does Tim remember backing over the gas pump Never mind fuck the gas pump Bill said It s a presence of mind See Tim was in that area the word presence reminded me he uses that word a lot The Presence as he calls it was there in the desert The Parousia I said Right Bill emphatically nodded That would be anokhi I said Would it What he was looking for Apparently he found it I said What did Barefoot say to all this That s when he told me when he realized I was a bodhisattva I came back Tim came back I mean out of compassion for others For those he loves Such as you What is Barefoot going to do with this news Nothing Nothing I echoed nodding There s no way I can prove it Bill said To skeptical minds Edgar pointed that out Why can t you prove it It should be easy to prove it You have access to everything Tim knew like you said all the theology details of his personal life Facts It should be the most simple matter on Earth to prove Can I prove it to you Bill said I can t even prove it to you It s like belief in God you can know God know he exists you can experience him and yet you can never prove to anyone else that you ve experienced him Do you believe in God now I said Sure He nodded I guess you believe in a lot of things now I said Because of Tim in me I know a lot of things it isn t just belief It s like He gestured earnestly Having swallowed a computer or the whole Britannica a whole library The facts the ideas come and go and just whizz around in my head they go too fast that s the problem I don't understand them I can t remember them I can t write them down or explain them to other people It s like having KPFA turned on inside your head twenty four hours a day without cease In many respects it s an affliction But it s interesting Have fun with your thoughts I said to myself That is what Harry Stack Sullivan said schizophrenics do they have endless fun with their thoughts and forget the world There is not much you can say when someone unveils an account such as Bill Lundborg s assuming that anyone ever unveiled such a narration before It did of course resemble what Tim and Kirsten had revealed to me that is the wrong word when they returned from England after Jeff s death But that had been minor compared with this This I thought consists of the ultimate escalation the monument itself The other narration was only the marker pointing to the monument Madness like small fish runs in hosts in vast numbers of instances It is not solitary Madness does not remain content it fans out across the landscape or seascape whichever Yes I thought it is like we are under water not in a dream as Barefoot says but in a tank and being observed for our bizarre behavior and our more bizarre beliefs I am a metaphor junkie Bill Lundborg is a madness junkie unable to get enough of it he possesses a boundless appetite for it and will obtain it by whatever means possible Just when it seemed too as if madness had passed out of the world First John Lennon s death and now this and for me on the same day I could not say and yet he is so plausible Because Bill was not plausible it is not a plausible matter Probably even Edgar Barefoot recognized that well however a Sufi phrases such moksa to himself that someone is sick and needs help but is touchingly appealing is guileless and not going to do any harm This madness arose from pain from the loss of a mother and what almost certainly amounted to a father in the true sense of the word I felt it I feel it I always will feel it as long as I live But Bill s solution could not be mine Any more than mine managing the record store could be his We each must find our own solution and in particular we each must solve the sort of problem that death creates creates for others but not death only madness also madness leading to final death as its end state its logical goal When my original anger at Bill Lundborg s psychosis had subsided it did subside I began to view it as funny The utility of Bill Lundborg not just for himself but as I viewed it to all of us consisted in his grounding in the concrete This precisely he had lost His showing up at Edgar Barefoot s seminar disclosed the change in Bill the kid I had known formerly known would never have set foot in such surroundings Bill had gone the way of the rest of us not the way of all flesh but the way of our intellects into nonsense and the foolish there to languish without a trace of anything redemptive Except of course Bill could now emotionally deal with the assortment of deaths that had plagued us Was my solution any better I worked I read I listened to music I bought music in the form of records I lived a professional life and yearned to move into the A R Division of Capitol Records down in Southern California There my future lay there were the tangible things that records had become for me not something to enjoy but something to first buy and then sell That the bishop had returned from the next world and now inhabited Bill Lundborg s mind or brain that couldn t be for obvious reasons One knows this instinctively one does not debate this one perceives this as absolute fact it cannot happen I could quiz Bill forever trying to establish the presence in him of facts known only to me and to Tim but this would lead nowhere Like the dinner Tim and I had eaten at the Chinese restaurant on University Avenue in Berkeley all data became suspect because there are multiple ways that data can arise within the human mind ways more readily acceptable and explained than to assume that one man died in Israel and his psyche floated halfway across the world until it discriminated Bill Lundborg from all the other people in the United States and then dove into that person into that waiting brain and took up residence there to sputter with ideas thoughts and memories half baked notions in other words the bishop as we had known him the bishop himself like a sort of plasma This does not lie within the domain of the real It lies elsewhere it is the invention of derangement of a young man who grieved over the suicide of his mother and the sudden death of a father figure grieved and tried to understand and one day into Bill s mind came not Bishop Timothy Archer but the concept of Timothy Archer the notion that Timothy Archer was there in him spiritually a ghost There is a difference between the notion of something and that something itself Still upon the lessening of my original anger I felt sympathy toward Bill because I understood why he had gone this route he had not willed it out of perversity it did not consist of so to speak optional madness but rather madness compelled on him thrust onto him forcibly whether he liked it or not It had simply happened Bill Lundborg the first of us to be crazy had become now the last of us to be crazy the only genuine issue could best be phrased this way could anything be done about it Which raises a deeper question should anything be done about it I pondered that during the next couple of weeks Bill he told me had no major friends he lived alone in a rented room in East Oakland eating his meals at a Mexican cafe Perhaps I said to myself I owe it to Jeff and Kirsten and Tim to Tim especially to straighten Bill out That way there would be a survivor That is of course in addition to myself Indubitably I had survived But survived as I had for some time realized as a machine still this is survival At least my mind had not been invaded by alien intelligences who thought in Greek Latin and Hebrew and used terms I could not comprehend Anyhow I liked Bill it would not be a burden on me to see him again to spend time with him Together Bill and I could summon back the people we had loved these were the same people we had known and our pooled memories would yield up a great crop of circumstantial details the little bits that made of memory the semblance of the veridical which is an ornate way of saying that my seeing Bill Lundborg would make it possible for me to experience Tim and Kirsten and Jeff again because Bill like me had once experienced them and would understand who I was talking about Anyhow we both were attending Edgar Barefoot s seminar Bill and I would run into each other there for better or worse My respect for Barefoot had climbed due of course to the personal interest he had taken in me I had warmed to that I needed that Barefoot had sensed it I interpreted Bill s statement that the bishop had been interested in me sexually as an oblique way of saying that he himself was interested in me sexually I pondered that and came to the conclusion that Bill was too young for me Anyhow why get involved with someone classified as a hebephrenic schizophrenic Hampton who had had traces rather more than traces of paranoia and hypomania had been enough trouble and it had been difficult to rid myself of him In fact it was not demonstrable that I had gotten rid of him Hampton still phoned me complaining aggressively that when I kicked him out of my house I had kept certain choice records books and prints that in truth belonged to him What bothered me about my getting involved with Bill lay in my sense of the ferocity of madness It can consume its owner leave him look around for more If I was a rickety machine I stood in danger of that madness for I was not all that psychologically intact Enough people had gone mad and died already why add myself to the list And perhaps worst of all I discerned the kind of future that awaited Bill He had no future Someone with hebephrenia has dealt himself out of the game of process growth and time he simply recycles his own nutty thoughts forever enjoying them even though like transmitted information they degenerate They become finally noise And the signal that is intellect fades out Bill would know this having planned at one time to become a computer programmer he would be familiar with Shannon s information theories This is not the sort of thing you want to tie into Bringing my little brother Harvey along I picked up Bill on my day off and drove up into Tilden Park by Lake Anza and the clubhouse and barbecue stoves there the three of us broiled hamburgers and we tossed a Frisbie around and had a hell of a time We had brought a Ghetto blaster with us one of those super sophisticated two channel two speaker combination radio and tape deck masterpieces that Japan turns out and we listened to the rock group Queen and we drank beer except for Harvey and ran around and then when it didn t seem anyone was watching or cared Bill and I shared a joint Harvey while we did that tried out all the heat sensor controls of the Ghetto blaster and then concentrated on picking up Radio Moscow on its shortwave You can go to jail for that Bill told him Listening to the enemy Bull Harvey said I wonder what Tim and Kirsten would say I said to Bill if they could see us now I can tell you what Tim is saying Bill said What does he say I said relaxed by the marijuana Bill said He says that he s thinking that it is peaceful here and he has finally found peace Good I said I could never get him to smoke grass They smoked it Bill said Him and Kirsten when we weren t around He didn t like it But he likes it now This is very good grass I said They probably had local stuff They wouldn t know the difference I pondered over what Bill had said Did they really turn on Is that true Yes Bill said He s thinking about that now he s remembering I regarded him In a way you're lucky I said To find your solution I wouldn t mind having him in me In my brain I mean I giggled it was that kind of grass Then I wouldn t be so lonely And then I said Why didn t he come back to me Why to you I knew him better After a moment of reflection Bill said Because it would have wrecked you See I'm used to voices in my head and thoughts that aren't my own I can accept it It s Tim that s the bodhisattva not you I said It was Tim who came back out of compassion And then I thought with a start My God do I believe it now When you're high on good grass you can believe anything which is why it sells for as much as it does now That s right Bill said I can feel his compassion He sought wisdom the Holy Wisdom of God what Tim calls Hagia Sophia he equates it with anokhi God s pure consciousness And then when he got there and the Presence entered him he realized that it was not wisdom that he wanted but compassion he already had wisdom but it hadn t done him or anyone else any good Yes I said he mentioned Hagia Sophia to me That s some of the Latin he thinks in Greek Whatever Tim thought that with Christ s absolute wisdom he could read the Book of the Spinners and untangle the future for Tim so Tim could figure out a way to evade his fate that s why he went to Israel I know I said Christ can read the Book of the Spinners Bill said The fate of every human is inscribed in it No human being has ever read it Where is this book All around us Bill said I think anyhow Wait a sec Tim is thinking something Very clearly He remained silent and withdrawn for a time Tim is thinking The last canto Canto Thirty three of Paradiso He s thinking God is the book of the universe and you read that you read it the night you had the abscessed tooth Is that right Bill asked me That s right I said It made a great impression on me that whole last part of the Commedia Edgar says that the Divine Comedy is based on Sufi sources Bill said Maybe so I said wondering about what Bill had said the statements about Dante s Commedia Strange I said The things you remember and why you remember them Because I had an abscessed tooth Tim says that Christ arranged that pain Bill said so the final part of the Divine Comedy would impress itself on you in a way that would never wear off One simple flame Oh shit he s thinking in a foreign language again Say it out loud I said as he thinks it Bill haltingly said Nel mezzo del cammin di nostra vita Mi ritrovai per una selva oscura Che la diritta via era smarrita I smiled That s how the Commedia begins There s more Bill said Lasciate ogni speranza voi ch entrate Abandon all hope you who enter here I said He wants me to tell you one thing more Bill said But I'm having trouble catching it Oh now I have it he thought it again very clearly for me La sua voluntate è nostra pace I don't recognize that I said Tim says it s the basic message of the Divine Comedy It means His will is our peace Meaning God I guess I guess so I said He must have learned that in the next world Bill said He certainly didn t learn it here Approaching us Harvey said I'm tired of the Queen tapes What else did we bring Did you manage to pick up Radio Moscow I asked Yeah but the Voice jammed it The Russians switched to another frequency probably the thirty meter band but I got tired of looking for it The Voice always jams it We ll be going home soon I said and passed the remains of the joint to Bill IT BECAME NECESSARY to rehospitalize Bill sooner than I had expected He entered voluntarily accepting this as a fact of life a perpetual fact of his life anyhow After they had signed Bill in I met with his psychiatrist a heavyset middle aged man with a mustache and rimless glasses a sort of portly but good natured authority figure who at once read me my mistakes in order of descending importance You shouldn t be encouraging him to use drugs Dr Greeby said the file on Bill open before him across the surface of his desk You call grass drugs I said For someone with Bill s precarious mental balance any intoxicant is dangerous however mild He goes into the trip but he never really comes out We have him on Haldol now he seems able to tolerate the side effects Had I known the harm I was doing I said I would have done otherwise He glanced at me We learn by erring I said Miss Archer Mrs Archer I said The prognosis on Bill is not good Mrs Archer I think you should be aware of that since you seem to be the one closest to him Dr Greeby frowned Archer Are you related to the late Episcopal Bishop Timothy Archer My father in law I said That s who Bill thinks he is Sufferin succotash I said Bill has the delusion that he has become your late father in law due to a mystical experience He does not merely see and hear Bishop Archer he is Bishop Archer Then Bill actually knew Bishop Archer I take it They rotated tires together I said You are a very smart assed woman Dr Greeby said I said nothing to that You have helped put Bill back in the hospital the doctor said I said And we had a couple of good times together We also had some very unhappy times together having to do with the death of friends I think those deaths contributed more to Bill s decline than did the smoking of grass in Tilden Park Please don't see him any more Dr Greeby said What I said startled and dismayed a rush of fear overcame me and I felt myself flush in pain Wait a minute I said He s my friend You have a generally supercilious attitude toward me and toward the world in all aspects You obviously are a highly educated person a product of the state university system I d guess that you graduated from U C Berkeley probably in the English Department you feel you know everything you're doing great harm to Bill who is not a worldly wise sophisticated person you're also doing great harm to yourself but that is not my concern You are a brittle harsh person who But they were my friends I said Find somebody in the Berkeley community the doctor said And stay away from Bill As Bishop Archer s daughter in law you reinforce his delusion in fact his delusion is probably an introjection of you a displaced sexual attachment acting outside his conscious control I said And you are full of recondite bullshit I ve seen dozens like you in my professional career Dr Greeby said You don't faze me and you don't interest me Berkeley is full of women like you I will change I said my heart full of panic That I doubt the doctor said and closed up Bill s file After I left his office ejected virtually I roamed about the hospital at a loss stunned and afraid and also angry angry mostly at myself for lipping off I had lipped off because I was nervous but the harm was done Shit I said to myself Now I ve lost the last of them I go back now to the record store I said to myself and check the back orders to see what did and didn t arrive There will be a dozen customers lined up at the register and the phones will be ringing Fleetwood Mac albums will be selling Helen Reddy albums will not be Nothing will have changed I can change I said to myself Lard butt is wrong it isn t too late Tim I thought why didn t I go to Israel with you As I left the hospital building and walked toward the parking lot I could see my little red Honda Civic from afar I spotted a group of patients trailing along behind a psych tech they had gotten off a yellow bus and were now returning to the hospital Hands in the pockets of my coat I walked toward them wondering if Bill was among them I did not see Bill in the group and I continued on past some benches past a fountain A grove of cedar trees grew on the far side of the hospital and several people sat here and there on the grass undoubtedly patients those with passes those well enough to exist for a time outside of stern control Among them Bill Lundborg wearing his usual ill fitting pants and shirt sat at the base of a tree intent on something he held I approached him slowly and quietly He did not look up until I had almost reached him suddenly aware of me now he raised his head Hi Bill I said Angel Bill said look what I found I knelt down to see He had found a stand of mushrooms growing at the base of the tree white mushrooms with I discovered when I broke one off pink gills Harmless the pink gilled and brown gilled mushrooms are by and large not toxic It is the white gilled mushrooms that you must avoid for often they are the amanitas such as the Destroying Angel What have you got I said It is growing here Bill said in wonder What I searched for in Israel What I went so far to find This is the vita verna mushroom that Pliny the Elder mentions in his Historia Naturalis I forget which book He chuckled in that familiar good humored way that I knew so well Probably Book Eight This exactly fits his description To me I said it looks like an ordinary edible mushroom that you see growing this time of year everywhere This is the anokhi Bill said Bill I began Tim he said reflexively Bill I'm taking off Dr Greeby says I wrecked your mind I'm sorry I stood up You never did that Bill said But I wish you had come to Israel with me You made a major mistake Angel and I did tell you that night at the Chinese restaurant Now you're locked into your customary mind set forever And there s no way I can change I said Smiling up at me in his guileless way Bill said I don't care I have what I want I have this He carefully handed me the mushroom that he had picked the ordinary harmless mushroom This is my body he said and this is my blood Eat drink and you will have eternal life I bent down and said speaking with my lips close to his ear so that only he could hear me I am going to fight to make you okay again Bill Lundborg Repairing automobile bodies and spray painting and other real things I will see you as you were I will not give up You will remember the ground again You hear me You understand Bill not looking at me murmured I am the true vine and my Father is the vinedresser Every branch in me that bears no fruit he cuts away and every No I said you're a man who spray paints automobiles and fixes transmissions and I will cause you to remember A time will come when you leave this hospital I will wait for you Bill Lundborg I kissed him then on the temple he reached to wipe it away as a child wipes a kiss away absently without intent or comprehension I am the Resurrection and the life Bill said I will see you again Bill I said and walked away The next time I attended Edgar Barefoot s seminar Barefoot noted Bill s absence and after he had finished talking he asked me about Bill Back inside looking out I said Come with me Barefoot led me from the lecture room to his living room I had never seen it before and discovered with surprise that his tastes ran to distressed oak rather than to the Oriental He put on a koto record which I recognized that is my job as a rare Kimio Eto pressing on World Pacific The record made in the late Fifties is worth something to collectors Barefoot played Midori No Asa which Eto wrote himself It is quite beautiful but sounds not at all Japanese I ll give you fifteen bucks for that record I said Barefoot said I ll tape it for you I want the record I said The record itself I get requests for it every now and then I thought to myself And don't tell me the beauty is in the music The value to collectors lies in the record itself this is not a matter that need be opened to debate I know records it is my business Coffee Barefoot said I accepted a cup of coffee and together Barefoot and I listened to the greatest living koto player twang away He s always going to be in and out of the hospital you realize I said when Barefoot turned the record over Is this something else you feel responsible for I ve been told that I am I said But I'm not It s good that you realize that I said If somebody thinks Tim Archer came back to him that somebody goes into the hospital And gets Thorazine Barefoot said It s Haldol now I said A refinement The new antipsychotic drugs are more precise Barefoot said One of the early church fathers believed in the Resurrection `because it was impossible Not `despite the fact that it was impossible but because it was impossible Tertullian I think it was Tim talked to me about it one time But how smart is that I said Not very smart I don't think Tertullian meant it to be I can t see anybody going through life that way I said To me that epitomizes this whole stupid business believing something because it s impossible What I see is people becoming mad and then dying first the madness then the death So you see death for Bill Barefoot said No I said because I am going to be waiting for him when he gets out of the hospital Instead of death he is going to get me How does that strike you As much better than death Barefoot said Then you approve of me I said Unlike Bill s doctor who thinks I helped put him in the hospital Are you living with anyone right now As a matter of fact I'm living alone I said Barefoot said I d like to see Bill move in with you when he gets out of the hospital I don't think he has ever lived with a woman except with his mother with Kirsten I d have to think a long time about that I said Why Because that s how I do things like that I don't mean for his sake What I said taken by surprise For your sake That way you would find out if it really is Tim Your question would be answered I said I have no question I know Take Bill in let him live with you Take care of him And maybe you ll find you're taking care of Tim in a certain real sense Which I think you always did or anyhow wanted to do Or if you didn t should have done He is very helpless Bill Tim The man in the hospital Who you care about Your last tie to other people I have friends I have my little brother I have the people at the store and my customers And you have me Barefoot said After a pause I said You too yes I nodded Suppose I said I think it may be Tim Actually Tim come back Well then I said I d stop coming to your seminars He eyed me intently I mean it I said You are not readily pushed around Barefoot said Not really I said I ve made certain serious mistakes I stood there doing nothing when Kirsten and Tim told me that Jeff had returned I did nothing and as a result they are now dead I wouldn t make that mistake again You genuinely foresee death for Bill then Yes I said Take him in Barefoot said and I tell you what I ll give you the Kimio Eto record we re listening to He smiled Kibo No Hikari this song is called `The Light of Hope I think it s appropriate Did Tertullian actually say he believed in the Resurrection because it is impossible I said Then this stuff started a long time ago It didn t begin with Kirsten and Tim Barefoot said you're going to have to stop coming to my seminars You do think it s Tim Yes Because Bill talks in languages he doesn t know In the Italian of Dante for instance And in Latin and Xenoglossy I said The sign I thought of the presence of the Holy Spirit as Tim pointed out that day we met at the Bad Luck Restaurant The very thing Tim doubted existed any more he doubted that it had ever existed probably According to what he anyhow could discern to the best of his ability And now we have it in Bill Lundborg claiming to be Tim I ll take Bill in Barefoot said He can live with me here on the houseboat No I said Not if you believe that stuff I ll bring him to my house in Berkeley rather than that And then it came to me that I had been maneuvered and I gazed at Edgar Barefoot he smiled and I thought Just the way Tim could do it control people In a sense Bishop Tim Archer is more alive in you than he is in Bill Good Barefoot said He extended his hand Let s shake on it to close the deal Do I get the Kimio Eto record I asked After I ve taped it But I do get the record itself Yes Barefoot said still holding onto my hand His grip was vigorous that too reminded me of Tim So maybe we do have Tim with us I thought One way or another It depends on how you define Tim Archer the ability to quote in Latin and Greek and Medieval Italian or the ability to save human lives Either way Tim seems to be still here Or here again I ll keep coming to your seminars I said Not for my sake No for my own Barefoot said Someday perhaps you ll come for the sandwich But I doubt that I think you will always need the pretext of words Do not be that pessimistic I said to myself I might surprise you We listened to the end of the koto record The last song on the second side is called Haru No Sugata which means The Mood of Early Spring We listened to that last and then Edgar Barefoot returned the record to its cover and handed it to me Thank you I said I finished my coffee and then left The weather struck me as good I felt a lot better And I could probably get almost thirty dollars for the record I had not seen a copy in years it has long been out of print You must keep these things in mind when you operate a record store And acquiring it that day amounted to a sort of prize for doing what I intended to do anyhow I had outsmarted Edgar Barefoot and I felt happy Tim would have enjoyed it Were he alive ",

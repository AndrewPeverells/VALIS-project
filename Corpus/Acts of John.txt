"ACTS_OF_JOHN Now John was hastening to Ephesus moved thereto by a vision Damonicus therefore and Aristodemus his kinsman and a certain very rich man Cleobius and the wife of Marcellus hardly prevailed to keep him for one day in Miletus reposing themselves with him And when very early in the morning they had set forth and already about four miles of the journey were accomplished a voice came from heaven in the hearing of all of us saying John thou art about to give glory to thy Lord in Ephesus whereof thou shalt know thou and all the brethren that are with thee and certain of them that are there which shall believe by thy means John therefore pondered rejoicing in himself what it should be that should befall him at Ephesus and said Lord behold I go according to thy will let that be done which thou desirest And as we drew near to the city Lycomedes the praetor of the Ephesians a man of large substance met us and falling at John s feet besought him saying Is thy name John the God whom thou preachest hath sent thee to do good unto my wife who hath been smitten with palsy now these seven days and lieth incurable But glorify thou thy God by healing her and have compassion on us For as I was considering with myself what resolve to take in this matter one stood by me and said Lycomedes cease from this thought which warreth against thee for it is evil submit not thyself unto it For I have compassion upon mine handmaid Cleopatra and have sent from Miletus a man named John who shall raise her up and restore her to thee whole Tarry not therefore thou servant of the God who hath manifested himself unto me but hasten unto my wife who hath no more than breath And straightway John went from the gate with the brethren that were with him and Lycomedes unto his house But Cleobius said to his young men Go ye to my kinsman Callippus and receive of him comfortable entertainment for I am come hither with his son that we may find all things decent Now when Lycomedes came with John into the house wherein his wife lay he caught hold again of his feet and said See lord the withering of the beauty see the youth see the renowned flower of my poor wife whereat all Ephesus was wont to marvel wretched me I have suffered envy I have been humbled the eye of mine enemies hath smitten me I have never wronged any though I might have injured many for I looked before to this very thing and took care lest I should see any evil or any such ill fortune as this What profit then hath Cleopatra from my anxiety what have I gained by being known for a pious man until this day nay I suffer more than the impious in that I see thee Cleopatra lying in such plight The sun in his course shall no more see me conversing with thee I will go before thee Cleopatra and rid myself of life I will not spare mine own safety though it be yet young I will defend myself before Justice that I have rightly deserted for I may indict her as judging unrighteously I will be avenged on her when I come before her as a ghost of life I will say to her Thou didst force me to leave the light when thou didst rob me of Cleopatra thou didst cause me to become a corpse when thou sentest me this ill fortune thou didst compel me to insult Providence by cutting off my joy in life And with yet more words Lycomedes addressing Cleopatra came near to the bed and cried aloud and lamented but John pulled him away and said Cease from these lamentations and from thine unfitting words thou must not disobey him that appeared unto thee for know that thou shalt receive thy consort again Stand therefore with us that have come hither on her account and pray to the God whom thou sawest manifesting himself unto thee in dreams What then is it Lycomedes Awake thou also and open thy soul Cast off the heavy sleep from thee beseech the Lord entreat him for thy wife and he will raise her up But he fell upon the floor and lamented fainting It is evident from what follows that Lycomedes died but the text does not say so some words may have fallen out John therefore said with tears Alas for the fresh betraying of my vision for the new temptation that is prepared for me for the new device of him that contriveth against me the voice from heaven that was borne unto me in the way hath it devised this for me was it this that it foreshowed me should come to pass here betraying me to this great multitude of the citizens because of Lycomedes the man lieth without breath and I know well that they will not suffer me to go out of the house alive Why tarriest thou Lord why hast thou shut off from us thy good promise Do not I beseech thee Lord do not give him cause to exult who rejoiceth in the suffering of others give him not cause to dance who alway derideth us but let thy holy name and thy mercy make haste Raise up these two dead whose death is against me And even as John thus cried out the city of the Ephesians ran together to the house of Lycomedes hearing that he was dead And John beholding the great multitude that was come said unto the Lord Now is the time of refreshment and of confidence toward thee O Christ now is the time for us who are sick to have the help that is of thee O physician who healest freely keep thou mine entering in hither safe from derision I beseech thee Jesu succour this great multitude that it may come to thee who art Lord of all things behold the affliction behold them that lie here Do thou prepare even from them that are assembled for that end holy vessels for thy service when they behold thy gift For thyself hast said O Christ Ask and it shall be given you We ask therefore of thee O king not gold not silver not substance not possessions nor aught of what is on earth and perisheth but two souls by whom thou shalt convert them that are here unto thy way unto thy teaching unto thy liberty unto thy most excellent promise for when they perceive thy power in that those that have died are raised they will be saved some of them Do thou thyself therefore give them hope in thee and so go I unto Cleopatra and say Arise in the name of Jesus Christ And he came to her and touched her face and said Cleopatra He saith whom every ruler feareth and every creature and every power the abyss and all darkness and unsmiling death and the height of heaven and the circles of hell and the resurrection of the dead and the sight of the blind and the whole power of the prince of this world and the pride of the ruler Arise and be not an occasion unto many that desire not to believe or an affliction unto souls that are able to hope and to be saved And Cleopatra straightway cried with a loud voice I arise master save thou thine handmaid Now when she had arisen seven days the city of the Ephesians was moved at the unlooked for sight And Cleopatra asked concerning her husband Lycomedes but John said to her Cleopatra if thou keep thy soul unmoved and steadfast thou shalt forthwith have Lycomedes thine husband standing here beside thee if at least thou be not disturbed nor moved at that which hath befallen having believed on my God who by my means shall grant him unto thee alive Come therefore with me into thine other bedchamber and thou shalt behold him a dead corpse indeed but raised again by the power of my God And Cleopatra going with John into her bedchamber and seeing Lycomedes dead for her sake had no power to speak and ground her teeth and bit her tongue and closed her eyes raining down tears and with calmness gave heed to the apostle But John had compassion on Cleopatra when he saw that she neither raged nor was beside herself and called upon the perfect and condescending mercy saying Lord Jesus Christ thou seest the pressure of sorrow thou seest the need thou seest Cleopatra shrieking her soul out in silence for she constraineth within her the frenzy that cannot be borne and I know that for Lycomedes sake she also will die upon his body And she said quietly to John That have I in mind master and nought else And the apostle went to the couch whereon Lycomedes lay and taking Cleopatra s hand he said Cleopatra because of the multitude that is present and thy kinsfolk that have come in with strong crying say thou to thine husband Arise and glorify the name of God for he giveth back the dead to the dead And she went to her husband and said to him according as she was taught and forthwith raised him up And he when he arose fell on the floor and kissed John s feet but he raised him saying O man kiss not my feet but the feet of God by whose power ye are both arisen But Lycomedes said to John I entreat and adjure thee by the God in whose name thou hast raised us to abide with us together with all them that are with thee Likewise Cleopatra also caught his feet and said the same And John said to them For tomorrow I will be with you And they said to him again We shall have no hope in thy God but shall have been raised to no purpose if thou abide not with us And Cleobius with Aristodemus and Damonicus were touched in the soul and said to John Let us abide with them that they continue without offence towards the Lord So he continued there with the brethren There came together therefore a gathering of a great multitude on John s account and as he discoursed to them that were there Lycomedes who had a friend who was a skilful painter went hastily to him and said to him You see me in a great hurry to come to you come quickly to my house and paint the man whom I show you without his knowing it And the painter giving some one the necessary implements and colours said to Lycomedes Show him to me and for the rest have no anxiety And Lycomedes pointed out John to the painter and brought him near him and shut him up in a room from which the apostle of Christ could be seen And Lycomedes was with the blessed man feasting on the faith and the knowledge of our God and rejoiced yet more in the thought that he should possess him in a portrait The painter then on the first day made an outline of him and went away And on the next he painted him in with his colours and so delivered the portrait to Lycomedes to his great joy And lie took it and set it up in his own bedehamber and hung it with garlands so that later John when he perceived it said to him My beloved child what is it that thou always doest when thou comest in from the bath into thy bedchamber alone do not I pray with thee and the rest of the brethren or is there something thou art hiding from us And as he said this and talked jestingly with him he went into the bedchamber and saw the portrait of an old man crowned with garlands and lamps and altars set before it And he called him and said Lycomedes what meanest thou by this matter of the portrait can it be one of thy gods that is painted here for I see that thou art still living in heathen fashion And Lycomedes answered him My only God is he who raised me up from death with my wife but if next to that God it be right that the men who have benefited us should be called gods it is thou father whom I have had painted in that portrait whom I crown and love and reverence as having become my good guide And John who had never at any time seen his own face said to him Thou mockest me child am I like that in form thy Lord how canst thou persuade me that the portrait is like me And Lycomedes brought him a mirror And when he had seen himself in the mirror and looked earnestly at the portrait he said As the Lord Jesus Christ liveth the portrait is like me yet not like me child but like my fleshly image for if this painter who hath imitated this my face desireth to draw me in a portrait he will be at a loss the colours that are now given to thee and boards and plaster and glue and the position of my shape and old age and youth and all things that are seen with the eye But do thou become for me a good painter Lycomedes Thou hast colours which he giveth thee through me who painteth all of us for himself even Jesus who knoweth the shapes and appearances and postures and dispositions and types of our souls And the colours wherewith I bid thee paint are these faith in God knowledge godly fear friendship communion meekness kindness brotherly love purity simplicity tranquillity fearlessness griefiessness sobriety and the whole band of colours that painteth the likeness of thy soul and even now raiseth up thy members that were cast down and levelleth them that were lifted up and tendeth thy bruises and healeth thy wounds and ordereth thine hair that was disarranged and washeth thy face and chasteneth thine eyes and purgeth thy bowels and emptieth thy belly and cutteth off that which is beneath it and in a word when the whole company and mingling of such colours is come together into thy soul it shall present it to our Lord Jesus Christ undaunted whole and firm of shape But this that thou hast now done is childish and imperfect thou hast drawn a dead likeness of the dead There need be no portion of text lost at this point but possibly some few sentences have been omitted The transition is abrupt and the new episode has not as elsewhere a title of its own And he commanded Verus the brother that ministered to him to gather the aged women that were in all Ephesus and made ready he and Cleopatra and Lycomedes all things for the care of them Verus then came to John saying Of the aged women that are here over threescore years old I have found four only sound in body and of the rest some and some palsied and others sick And when he heard that John kept silence for a long time and rubbed his face and said O the slackness of them that dwell in Ephesus O the state of dissolution and the weakness toward God O devil that hast so long mocked the faithful in Ephesus Jesus who giveth me grace and the gift to have my confidence in him saith to me in silence Send after the old women that are sick and come with them into the theatre and through me heal them for there are some of them that will come unto this spectacle whom by these healings I will convert and make them useful for some end Now when all the multitude was come together to Lycomedes he dismissed them on John s behalf saying Tomorrow come ye to the theatre as many as desire to see the power of God And the multitude on the morrow while it was yet night came to the theatre so that the proconsul also heard of it and hasted and took his sent with all the people And a certain praetor Andromeus who was the first of the Ephesians at that time put it about that John had promised things impossible and incredible But if said he he is able to do any such thing as I hear let him come into the public theatre when it is open naked and holding nothing in his hands neither let him name that magical name which I have heard him utter John therefore having heard this and being moved by these words commanded the aged women to be brought into the theatre and when they were all brought into the midst some of them upon beds and others lying in a deep sleep and all the city had run together and a great silence was made John opened his mouth and began to say Ye men of Ephesus learn first of all wherefore I am visiting in your city or what is this great confidence which I have towards you so that it may become manifest to this general assembly and to all of you I have been sent then upon a mission which is not of man s ordering and not upon any vain journey neither am I a merchant that make bargains or exchanges but Jesus Christ whom I preach being compassionate and kind desireth by my means to convert all of you who are held in unbelief and sold unto evil lusts and to deliver you from error and by his power will I confound even the unbelief of your praetor by raising up them that lie before you whom ye all behold in what plight and in what sicknesses they are And to do this is not possible for me if they perish therefore shall they be healed But this first I have desired to sow in your ears even that ye should take care for your souls on which account I am come unto you and not expect that this time will be for ever for it is but a moment and not lay up treasures upon the earth where all things do fade Neither think that when ye have gotten children ye can rest upon them and try not for their sakes to defraud and overreach Neither ye poor be vexed if ye have not wherewith to minister unto pleasures for men of substance when they are diseased call you happy Neither ye rich rejoice that ye have much money for by possessing these things ye provide for yourselves grief that ye cannot be rid of when ye lose them and besides while it is with you ye are afraid lest some one attack you on account of it Thou also that art puffed up because of the shapeliness of thy body and art of an high look shalt see the end of the promise thereof in the grave and thou that rejoicest in adultery know that both law and nature avenge it upon thee and before these conscience and thou adulteress that art an adversary of the law knowest not whither thou shalt come in the end And thou that sharest not with the needy but hast monies laid up when thou departest out of this body and hast need of some mercy when thou burnest in fire shalt have none to pity thee and thou the wrathful and passionate know that thy conversation is like the brute beasts and thou drunkard and quarreller learn that thou losest thy senses by being enslaved to a shameful and dirty desire Thou that rejoicest in gold and delightest thyself with ivory and jewels when night falleth canst thou behold what thou lovest thou that art vanquished by soft raiment and then leavest life will those things profit thee in the place whither thou goest And let the murderer know that the condign punishment is laid up for him twofold after his departure hence Likewise also thou poisoner sorcerer robber defrauder sodomite thief and as many as are of that band ye shall come at last as your works do lead you unto unquenchable fire and utter darkness and the pit of punishment and eternal threatenings Wherefore ye men of Ephesus turn yourselves knowing this also that kings rulers tyrants boasters and they that have conquered in wars stripped of all things when they depart hence do suffer pain lodged in eternal misery And having thus said John by the power of God healed all the diseases This sentence must be an abridgement of a much longer narration The manuscript indicates no break at this point but we must suppose a not inconsiderable loss of text For one thing Andronicus who is here an unbeliever appears as a convert in the next few lines Now he is as we shall see later the husband of an eminent believer Drusiana and his and her conversion will have been told at some length and I do not doubt that among other things there was a discourse of John persuading them to live in continence Now the brethren from Miletus said unto John We have continued a long time at Ephesus if it seem good to thee let us go also to Smyrna for we hear already that the mighty works of God have reached it also And Andronicus said to them Whensoever the teacher willeth then let us go But John said Let us first go unto the temple of Artemis for perchance there also if we show ourselves the servants of the Lord will be found After two days then was the birthday of the idol temple John therefore when all were clad in white alone put on black raiment and went up into the temple And they took him and essayed to kill him But John said Ye are mad to set upon me a man that is the servant of the only God And he gat him up upon an high pedestal and said unto them Ye run hazard men of Ephesus of being like in character to the sea every river that floweth in and every spring that runneth down and the rains and waves that press upon each other and torrents full of rocks are made salt together by the bitter telementt that is therein So ye also remaining unchanged unto this day toward true godliness are become corrupted by your ancient rites of worship How many wonders and healings of diseases have ye seen wrought through me And yet are ye blinded in your hearts and cannot recover sight What is it then O men of Ephesus I have adventured now and come up even into this your idol temple I will convict you of being most godless and dead from the understanding of mankind Behold I stand here ye all say that ye have a goddess even Artemis pray then unto her that I alone may die or else I only if ye are not able to do this will call upon mine own god and for your unbelief I will cause every one of you to die But they who had beforetime made trial of him and had seen dead men raised up cried out Slay us not so we beseech thee John We know that thou canst do it And John said to them If then ye desire not to die let that which ye worship be confounded and wherefore it is confounded that ye also may depart from your ancient error For now is it time that either ye be converted by my God or I myself die by your goddess for I will pray in your presence and entreat my God that mercy be shown unto you And having so said he prayed thus O God that art God above all that are called gods that until this day hast been set at nought in the city of the Ephesians that didst put into my mind to come into this place whereof I never thought that dost convict every manner of worship by turning men unto thee at whose name every idol fleeth and every evil spirit and every unclean power now also by the flight of the evil spirit here at thy name even of him that deceiveth this great multitude show thou thy mercy in this place for they have been made to err And as John spake these things immediately the altar of Artemis was parted into many pieces and all the things that were dedicated in the temple fell and MS that which seemed good to him was rent asunder and likewise of the images of the gods more than seven And the half of the temple fell down so that the priest was slain at one blow by the falling of the The multitude of the Ephesians therefore cried out One is the God of John one is the God that hath pity on us for thou only art God now are we turned to thee beholding thy marvellous works have mercy on us O God according to thy will and save us from our great error And some of them lying on their faces made supplication and some kneeled and besought and some rent their clothes and wept and others tried to escape But John spread forth his hands and being uplifted in soul said unto the Lord Glory be to thee my Jesus the only God of truth for that thou dost gain thy servants by divers devices And having so said he said to the people Rise up from the floor ye men of Ephesus and pray to my God and recognize the invisible power that cometh to manifestation and the wonderful works which are wrought before your eyes Artemis ought to have succoured herself her servant ought to have been helped of her and not to have died Where is the power of the evil spirit where are her sacrifices where her birthdays where her festivals where are the garlands where is all that sorcery and the poisoning that is sister thereto But the people rising up from off the floor went hastily and cast down the rest of the idol temple crying The God of John only do we know and him hereafter do we worship since he hath had mercy upon us And as John came down from thence much people took hold of him saying Help us O John Assist us that do perish in vain Thou seest our purpose thou seest the multitude following thee and hanging upon thee in hope toward thy God We have seen the way wherein we went astray when we lost him we have seen our gods that were set up in vain we have seen the great and shameful derision that is come to them but suffer us we pray thee to come unto thine house and to be succoured without hindrance Receive us that are in bewilderment And John said to them Men believe that for your sakes I have continued in Ephesus and have put off my journey unto Smyrna and to the rest of the cities that there also the servants of Christ may turn to him But since I am not yet perfectly assured concerning you I have continued praying to my God and beseeching him that I should then depart from Ephesus when I have confirmed you in the faith and whereas I see that this is come to pass and yet more is being fulfilled I will not leave you until I have weaned you like children from the nurse s milk and have set you upon a firm rock John therefore continued with them receiving them in the house of Andromeus And one of them that were gathered laid down the dead body of the priest of Artemis before the door of the temple for he was his kinsman and came in quickly with the rest saying nothing of it John therefore after the discourse to the brethren and the prayer and the thanksgiving and the laying of hands upon every one of the congregation said by the spirit There is one here who moved by faith in God hath laid down the priest of Artemis before the gate and is come in and in the yearning of his soul taking care first for himself hath thought thus in himself It is better for me to take thought for the living than for my kinsman that is dead for I know that if I turn to the Lord and save mine own soul John will not deny to raise up the dead also And John arising from his place went to that into which that kinsman of the priest who had so thought was entered and took him by the hand and said Hadst thou this thought when thou camest unto me my child And he taken with trembling and affright said Yes lord and cast himself at his feet And John said Our Lord is Jesus Christ who will show his power in thy dead kinsman by raising him up And he made the young man rise and took his hand and said It is no great matter for a man that is master of great mysteries to continue wearying himself over small things or what great thing is it to rid men of diseases of the body And yet holding the young man by the hand he said I say unto thee child go and raise the dead thyself saying nothing but this only John the servant of God saith to thee Arise And the young man went to his kinsman and said this only and much people was with him and entered in unto John bringing him alive And John when he saw him that was raised said Now that thou art raised thou dost not truly live neither art partaker or heir of the true life wilt thou belong unto him by whose name and power thou wast raised And now believe and thou shall live unto all ages And he forthwith believed upon the Lord Jesus and thereafter clave unto John We remained four years in the region which was wholly converted and then returned to Ephesus Now on the next day John having seen in a dream that he must walk three miles outside the gates neglected it not but rose up early and set out upon the way together with the brethren And a certain countryman who was admonished by his father not to take to himself the wife of a fellow labourer of his who threatened to kill him this young man would not endure the admonition of his father but kicked him and left him without speech And John seeing what had befallen said unto the Lord Lord was it on this account that thou didst bid me come out hither to day But the young man beholding the violence of death and looking to be taken drew out the sickle that was in his girdle and started to run to his own abode and John met him and said Stand still thou most shameless devil and tell me whither thou runnest bearing a sickle that thirsteth for blood And the young man was troubled and cast the iron on the ground and said to him I have done a wretched and barbarous deed and I know it and so I determined to do an evil yet worse and more cruel even to die myself at once For because my father was alway curbing me to sobriety that I should live without adultery and chastely I could not endure him to reprove me and I kicked him and slew him and when I saw what was done I was hasting to the woman for whose sake I became my father s murderer with intent to kill her and her husband and myself last of all for I could not bear to be seen of the husband of the woman and undergo the judgement of death And John said to him That I may not by going away and leaving you in danger give place to him that desireth to laugh and sport with thee come thou with me and show me thy father where he lieth And if I raise him up for thee wilt thou hereafter abstain from the woman that is become a snare to thee And the young man said If thou raisest up my father himself for me alive and if I see him whole and continuing in life I will hereafter abstain from her And while he was speaking they came to the place where the old man lay dead and many passers by were standing near thereto And John said to the youth Thou wretched man didst thou not spare even the old age of thy father And he weeping and tearing his hair said that he repented thereof and John the servant of the Lord said Thou didst show me I was to set forth for this place thou knewest that this would come to pass from whom nothing can be hid of things done in life that givest me power to work every cure and healing by thy will now also give me this old man alive for thou seest that his murderer is become his own judge and spare him thou only Lord that spared not his father counselled him for the best And with these words he came near to the old man and said My Lord will not be weak to spread out his kind pity and his condescending mercy even unto thee rise up therefore and give glory to God for the work that is come to pass at this moment And the old man said I arise Lord And he rose and sat up and said I was released from a terrible life and had to bear the insults of my son dreadful and many and his want of natural affection and to what end hast thou called me back O man of the living God thou art raised only for the same end it were better for thee to die but raise thyself unto better things And he took him and led him into the city preaching unto him the grace of God so that before he entered the gate the old man believed But the young man when he beheld the unlooked for raising of his father and the saving of himself took a sickle and mutilated himself and ran to the house wherein he had his adulteress and reproached her saying For thy sake I became the murderer of my father and of you two and of myself there thou hast that which is alike guilty of all For on me God hath had mercy that I should know his power And he came back and told John in presence of the brethren what he had done But John said to him He that put it into thine heart young man to kill thy father and become the adulterer of another man s wife the same made thee think it a right deed to take away also the unruly members But thou shouldest have done away not with the place of sin but the thought which through those members showed itself harmful for it is not the instruments that are injurious but the unseen springs by which every shameful emotion is stirred and cometh to light Repent therefore my child of this fault and having learnt the wiles of Satan thou shalt have God to help thee in all the necessities of thy soul And the young man kept silence and attended having repented of his former sins that he should obtain pardon from the goodness of God and he did not separate from John When then these things had been done by him in the city of the Ephesians they of Smyrna sent unto him saying We hear that the God whom thou preachest is not envious and hath charged thee not to show partiality by abiding in one place Since then thou art a preacher of such a God come unto Smyrna and unto the other cities that we may come to know thy God and having known him may have our hope in him Now one day as John was seated a partridge flew by and came and played in the dust before him and John looked on it and wondered And a certain priest came who was one of his hearers and came to John and saw the partridge playing in the dust before him and was offended in himself and said Can such and so great a man take pleasure in a partridge playing in the dust But John perceiving in the spirit the thought of him said to him It were better for thee also my child to look at a partridge playing in the dust and not to defile thyself with shameful and profane practices for he who awaiteth the conversion and repentance of all men hath brought thee here on this account for I have no need of a partridge playing in the dust For the partridge is thine own soul Then the elder hearing this and seeing that he was not bidden but that the apostle of Christ had told him all that was in his heart fell on his face on the earth and cried aloud saying Now know I that God dwelleth in thee O blessed John for he that tempteth thee tempteth him that cannot be tempted And he entreated him to pray for him And he instructed him and delivered him the rules and let him go to his house glorifying God that is over all ",

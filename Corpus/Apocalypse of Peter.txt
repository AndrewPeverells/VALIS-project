"APOCALYPSE_OF_PETER a The Scripture saith that the children which have been exposed are delivered to a care taking angel by whom they are educated and made to grow up and they shall be it saith as the faithful of an hundred years old are here b Wherefore also Peter in the Apocalypse saith And a flash of fire leaping from those children and smiting the eyes of the women Ibid The providence of God doth not light upon them only that are in the flesh For example Peter in the Apocalypse saith that the children born out of due time that would have been of the better part —these are delivered to a care taking angel that they may partake of knowledge and obtain the better abode having suffered what they would have suffered had they been in the body But the others shall only obtain salvation as beings that have been injured and had mercy shown to them and shall continue without torment receiving that as a reward But the milk of the mothers flowing from their breasts and congealing saith Peter in the Apocalypse shall engender small beasts devouring the flesh and these running upon them devour them teaching that the torments come to pass because of the sins From the Symposium of Methodius of Olympus He does not name his source Whence also we have received in inspired writings that children born untimely—even if they be the offspring of adultery—are delivered to care taking angels For if they had come into being contrary to the will and ordinance of that blessed nature of God how could they have been delivered to angels to be nourished up in all repose and tranquillity And how could they have confidently summoned their parents before the judgement seat of Christ to accuse them saying Thou O Lord didst not begrudge us this light that is common to all but these exposed us to death contemning thy commandment The word rendered care taking in these passages is a very rare one— τημελοῠχος tēmelouchos so rare that it was mistaken by later readers for the proper name of an angel and we find an angel Temeluchus in Paul John and elsewhere A similar case is that of the word ταρταροχος Tartaruchus keeper of hell which is applied to angels in our Apocalypse and is also taken in the Ethiopic version in Paul and in other writings to be a proper name From the Apocritica of Macarius Magnes of whom we know little His book consists of extracts from a heathen opponent’s attack on Christianity and his own answers The heathen writer says And by way of superfluity let this also be cited which is said in the Apocalypse of Peter He introduces the heaven to be judged along with the earth thus The earth he says shall present all men to God to be judged in the day of judgement being itself also to be judged along with the heaven that encompasseth it Ibid And this again he says which is a statement full of impiety And every power of heaven shall be melted and the heaven shall be rolled up like a book and all the stars shall fall like leaves from the vine and as the leaves from the fig tree This very nearly coincides with Isa xxxiv and does not occur in our other texts of the Apocalypse In an old Latin homily on the Ten Virgins found and published by Dom Wilmart is this sentence The closed door is the river of fire by which the ungodly shall be kept out of the kingdom of God as is written in Daniel and in Peter in his Apocalypse That company of the foolish also shall arise and find the door shut that is the fiery river set against them The equivalent of all the above quotations is found in the Ethiopic text with one exception no The Akhmim text only contains something like no b one indication out of many that it is a shortened and I would say secondary text THE AKHMIM FRAGMENT Many of them shall be false prophets and shall teach ways and diverse doctrines of perdition And they shall become sons of of perdition And then shall God come unto my faithful ones that hunger and thirst and are afflicted and prove their souls in this life and shall judge the sons of iniquity And the Lord added and said Let us go unto the mountain pray And going with him we the twelve disciples besought him that he would show us one of our righteous brethren that had departed out of the world that we might see what manner of men they are in their form and take courage and encourage also the men that should hear us And as we prayed suddenly there appeared two men standing before the Lord upon whom we were not able to look For there issued from their countenance a ray as of the sun and their raiment was shining so as the eye of man never saw the like for no mouth is able to declare nor heart to conceive the glory wherewith they were clad and the beauty of their countenance Whom when we saw we were astonied for their bodies were whiter than any snow and redder than any rose And the redness of them was mingled with the whiteness and in a word I am not able to declare their beauty For their hair was curling and flourishing and fell comely about their countenance and their shoulders like a garland woven of nard and various flowers or like a rainbow in the air such was their comeliness We then seeing the beauty of them were astonied at them for they appeared suddenly And I drew near to the Lord and said Who are these He saith to me These are your righteous brethren whose appearance ye did desire to see And I said unto him And where are all the righteous or of what sort is the world wherein they are and possess this glory And the Lord showed me a very great region outside this world exceeding bright with light and the air of that place illuminated with the beams of the sun and the earth of itself flowering with blossoms that fade not and full of spices and plants fair flowering and incorruptible and bearing blessed fruit And so great was the blossom that the odour thereof was borne thence even unto us And the dwellers in that place were clad with the raiment of shining angels and their raiment was like unto their land And angels ran round about them there And the glory of them that dwelt there was all equal and with one voice they praised the Lord God rejoicing in that place The Lord saith unto us This is the place of your leaders the righteous men And I saw also another place over against that one very squalid and it was a place of punishment and they that were punished and the angels that punished them had their raiment dark according to the air of the place And some there were there hanging by their tongues and these were they that blasphemed the way of righteousness and under them was laid fire flaming and tormenting them And there was a great lake full of flaming mire wherein were certain men that turned away from righteousness and angels tormentors were set over them And there were also others women hanged by their hair above that mire which boiled up and these were they that adorned themselves for adultery And the men that were joined with them in the defilement of adultery were hanging by their feet and had their heads hidden in the mire and said We believed not that we should come unto this place And I saw the murderers and them that were consenting to them cast into a strait place full of evil creeping things and smitten by those beasts and so turning themselves about in that torment And upon them were set worms like clouds of darkness And the souls of them that were murdered stood and looked upon the torment of those murderers and said O God righteous is thy judgement And hard by that place I saw another strait place wherein the discharge and the stench of them that were in torment ran down and there was as it were a lake there And there sat women up to their necks in that liquor and over against them many children which were born out of due time sat crying and from them went forth rays of fire and smote the women in the eyes and these were they that conceived out of wedlock and caused abortion And other men and women were being burned up to their middle and cast down in a dark place and scourged by evil spirits and having their entrails devoured by worms that rested not And these were they that had persecuted the righteous and delivered them up And near to them again were women and men gnawing their lips and in torment and having iron heated in the fire set against their eyes And these were they that did blaspheme and speak evil of the way of righteousness And over against these were yet others men and women gnawing their tongues and having flaming fire in their mouths And these were the false witnesses And in another place were gravel stones sharper than swords or any spit heated with fire and men and women clad in filthy rags rolled upon them in torment And these were they that were rich and trusted in their riches and had no pity upon orphans and widows but neglected the commandments of God And in another great lake full of foul matter and blood and boiling mire stood men and women up to their knees And these were they that lent money and demanded usury upon usury And other men and women being cast down from a great rock fell to the bottom and again were driven by them that were set over them to go up upon the rock and thence were cast down to the bottom and had no rest from this torment And these were they that did defile their bodies behaving as women and the women that were with them were they that lay with one another as a man with a woman And beside that rock was a place full of much fire and there stood men which with their own hands had made images for themselves instead of God having rods of fire and smiting one another and never resting from this manner of torment And yet others near unto them men and women burning and turning themselves about and roasted as in a pan And these were they that forsook the way of God THE ETHIOPIC TEXT The Second Coming of Christ and Resurrection of the Dead who died because of their sins for that they kept not the commandment of God their creator And he pondered thereon that he might perceive the mystery of the Son of God the merciful and lover of mercy And when the Lord was seated upon the Mount of Olives his disciples came unto him And we besought and entreated him severally and prayed him saying unto him Declare unto us what are the signs of thy coming and of the end of the world that we may perceive and mark the time of thy coming and instruct them that come after us unto whom we preach the word of thy gospel and whom we set over thy church that they when they hear it may take heed to themselves and mark the time of thy coming And our Lord answered us saying Take heed that no man deceive you and that ye be not doubters and serve other gods Many shall come in my name saying I am the Christ Believe them not neither draw near unto them For the coming of the Son of God shall not be plain but as the lightning that shineth from the east unto the west so will I come upon the clouds of heaven with a great host in my majesty with my cross going before my face will I come in my majesty shining sevenfold more than the sun will I come in my majesty with all my saints mine angels And my Father shall set a crown upon mine head that I may judge the quick and the dead and recompense every man according to his works And ye take ye the likeness thereof from the fig tree so soon as the shoot thereof is come forth and the twigs grown the end of the world shall come And I Peter answered and said unto him Interpret unto me concerning the fig tree whereby we shall perceive it for throughout all its days doth the fig tree send forth shoots and every year it bringeth forth its fruit for its master What then meaneth the parable of the fig tree We know it not And the Master answered and said unto me Understandest thou not that the fig tree is the house of Israel Even as a man that planted a fig tree in his garden and it brought forth no fruit And he sought the fruit thereof many years and when he found it not he said to the keeper of his garden Root up this fig tree that it make not our ground to be unfruitful And the gardener said unto God to rid it of weeds and dig the ground round about it and water it If then it bear not fruit we will straightway remove its roots out of the garden and plant another in place of it Hast thou not understood that the fig tree is the house of Israel Verily I say unto thee when the twigs thereof have sprouted forth in the last days then shall feigned Christs come and awake expectation saying I am the Christ that am now come into the world And when they shall perceive the wickedness of their deeds they shall turn away after them and deny him even the first Christ whom they crucified and therein sinned a great sin But this deceiver is not the Christ And when they reject him he shall slay with the sword and there shall be many martyrs Then shall the twigs of the fig tree that is the house of Israel shoot forth many shall become martyrs at his hand Enoch and Elias shall be sent to teach them that this is the deceiver which must come into the world and do signs and wonders to deceive And therefore shall they that die by his hand be martyrs and shall be reckoned among the good and righteous martyrs who have pleased God in their life And he showed me in his right hand the souls of all men And on the palm of his right hand the image of that which shall be accomplished at the last day and how the righteous and the sinners shall be separated and how they †do† that are upright in heart and how the evil doers shall be rooted out unto all eternity We beheld how the sinners wept in great affliction and sorrow until all that saw it with their eyes wept whether righteous or angels and he himself also And I asked him and said unto him Lord suffer me to speak thy word concerning the sinners It were better for them if they had not been created And the Saviour answered and said unto me Peter wherefore speakest thou thus that not to have been created were better for them Thou resistest God Thou wouldest not have more compassion than he for his image for he hath created them and brought them forth out of not being Now because thou hast seen the lamentation which shall come upon the sinners in the last days therefore is thine heart troubled but I will show thee their works whereby they have sinned against the Most High Behold now what shall come upon them in the last days when the day of God and the day of the decision of the judgement of God cometh From the east unto the west shall all the children of men be gathered together before my Father that liveth for ever And he shall command hell to open its bars of adamant and give up all that is therein And the wild beasts and the fowls shall he command to restore all the flesh that they have devoured because he willeth that men should appear for nothing perisheth before God and nothing is impossible with him because all things are his For all things come to pass on the day of decision on the day of judgement at the word of God and as all things were done when he created the world and commanded all that is therein and it was done—even so shall it be in the last days for all things are possible with God And therefore saith he in the scripture Son of man prophesy upon the several bones and say unto the bones bone unto bone in joints sinew nerves flesh and skin and hair thereon And soul and spirit shall the great Uriel give them at the commandment of God for him hath God set over the rising again of the dead at the day of judgement Behold and consider the corns of wheat that are sown in the earth As things dry and without soul do men sow them in the earth and they live again and bear fruit and the earth restoreth them as a pledge entrusted unto it How much more shall God raise up on the day of decision them that believe in him and are chosen of him for whose sake he madethe world And all things shall the earth restore on the day of decision for it also shall be judged with them and the heaven with it And this shall come at the day of judgement upon them that have fallen away from faith in God and that have committed sin Floods of fire shall be let loose and darkness and obscurity shall come up and clothe and veil the whole world and the waters shall be changed and turned into coals of fire and all that is in them shall burn and the sea shall become fire Under the heaven shall be a sharp fire that cannot be quenched and floweth to fulfil the judgement of wrath And the stars shall fly in pieces by flames of fire as if they had not been created and the powers of the heaven shall pass away for lack of water and shall be as though they had not been †And the lightnings of heaven shall be no more and by their enchantment they shall affright the world† The spirits also of the dead bodies shall be like unto them and shall become fire at the commandment of God And so soon as the whole creation dissolveth the men that are in the east shall flee unto the west and they that are in the west unto the east they that are in the south shall flee to the north and they that are in the north unto the south And in all places shall the wrath of a fearful fire overtake them and an unquenchable flame driving them shall bring them unto the judgement of wrath unto the stream of unquenchable fire that floweth flaming with fire and when the waves thereof part themselves one from another burning there shall be a great gnashing of teeth among the children of men Then shall they all behold me coming upon an eternal cloud of brightness and the angels of God that are with me shall sit upon the throne of my glory at the right hand of my heavenly Father and he shall set a crown upon mine head And when the nations behold it they shall weep every nation apart Then shall he command them to enter into the river of fire while the works of every one of them shall stand before them to every man according to his deeds As for the elect that have done good they shall come unto me and not see death by the devouring fire But the unrighteous the sinners and the hypocrites shall stand in the depths of darkness that shall not pass away and their chastisement is the fire and angels bring forward their sins and prepare for them a place wherein they shall be punished for ever Uriel the angel of God shall bring forth the souls of those sinners who perished in the flood and of all that dwelt in all idols in every molten image in every love and in pictures and of those that dwelt on all hills and in stones and by the wayside whom men called gods they shall burn them with them in everlasting fire and after that all of them with their dwelling places are destroyed they shall be punished eternally Then shall men and women come unto the place prepared for them By their tongues wherewith they have blasphemed the way of righteousness shall they be hanged up There is spread under them unquenchable fire that they escape it not Behold another place therein is a pit great and full In it are they that have denied righteousness and angels of punishment chastise them and there do they kindle upon them the fire of their torment And again behold women they hang them up by their neck and by their hair they shall cast them into the pit These are they which plaited their hair not for good but to turn them to fornication that they might ensnare the souls of men unto perdition And the men that lay with them in fornication shall be hung by their loins in that place of fire and they shall say one to another We knew not that we should come into everlasting punishment And the murderers and them that have made common cause with them shall they cast into the fire in a place full of venomous beasts and they shall be tormented without rest feeling their pains and their worms shall be as many in number as a dark cloud And the angel Ezraël shall bring forth the souls of them that have been slain and they shall behold the torment of them that slew them and say one to another Righteousness and justice is the judgement of God For we heard but we believed not that we should come into this place of eternal judgement And near by this flame shall be a pit great and very deep and into it floweth from above all manner of †torment † foulness and issue And women are swallowed up therein up to their necks and tormented with great pain These are they that have caused their children to be born untimely and have corrupted the work of God that created them Over against them shall be another place where sit their children alive and they cry unto God And flashes go forth from those children and pierce the eyes of them that for fornication s sake have caused their destruction Other men and women shall stand above them naked and their children stand over against them in a place of delight and sigh and cry unto God because of their parents saying These are they that have despised and cursed and transgressed thy commandments and delivered us unto death they have cursed the angel that formed us and have hanged us up and withheld from us the light which thou hast given unto all creatures And the milk of their mothers flowing from their breasts shall congeal and from it shall come beasts devouring flesh which shall come forth and turn and torment them for ever with their husbands because they forsook the commandments of God and slew their children As for their children they shall be delivered unto the angel Temlākos And they that slew them shall be tormented eternally for God willeth it so Ezraël the angel of wrath shall bring men and women the half of their bodies burning and cast them into a place of darkness even the hell of men and a spirit of wrath shall chastise them with all manner of torment and a worm that sleepeth not shall devour their entrails and these are the persecutors and betrayers of my righteous ones And beside them that are there shall be other men and women gnawing their tongues and they shall torment them with red hot iron and burn their eyes These are they that slander and doubt of my righteousness Other men and women whose works were done in deceitfulness shall have their lips cut off and fire entereth into their mouth and their entrails These are the false witnesses And beside them in a place near at hand †upon the stone shall be a pillar of fire † and the pillar is sharper than swords And there shall be men and women clad in rags and filthy garments and they shall be cast thereon to suffer the judgement of a torment that ceaseth not these are they that trusted in their riches and despised the widows and the woman with fatherless children before God And into another place hard by full of filth do they cast men and women up to the knees These are they that lent money and took usury And other men and women cast themselves down from an high place and return again and run and devils drive them †and they put them to the end of their wits† and they cast themselves down And thus do they continually and are tormented for ever These are they which have †cut† their flesh as of a man and the women that were with them and these are the men that defiled themselves together as women And beside them and beneath them shall the angel Ezraël prepare a place of much fire and all the idols of gold and silver all idols the work of men’s hands and the semblances of images of cats and lions of creeping things and wild beasts and the men and women that have prepared the images thereof shall be in chains of fire and shall be chastised because of their error before the idols and this is their judgement for ever And beside them shall be other men and women burning in the fire of the judgement and their torment is everlasting These are they that have forsaken the commandment of God and followed the of devils And there shall be another place very high Furthermore the angel Ezraël shall bring children and maidens to show them those that are tormented They shall be chastised with pains with hanging up and with a multitude of wounds which flesh devouring birds shall inflict upon them These are they that boast themselves in their sins and obey not their parents and follow not the instruction of their fathers and honour not them that are more aged than they Beside them shall be girls clad in darkness for a garment and they shall be sore chastised and their flesh shall be torn in pieces These are they that kept not their virginity until they were given in marriage and with these torments shall they be punished and shall feel them And again other men and women gnawing their tongues without ceasing and being tormented with everlasting fire These are the servants which were not obedient unto their masters and this then is their judgement for ever And hard by this place of torment shall be men and women dumb and blind whose raiment is white They shall crowd one upon another and fall upon coals of unquenchable fire These are they that give alms and say We are righteous before God whereas they have not sought after righteousness Ezraël the angel of God †shall bring them forth out of this fire and establish a judgement of decision† This then is their judgement A river of fire shall flow and all †judgement† shall be drawn down into the middle of the river And Uriel shall set them there And there are wheels of fire and men and women hung thereon by the strength of the whirling thereof †And they that are in the pit shall burn† now these are the sorcerers and sorceresses †Those wheels shall be in all decision by fire without number† Thereafter shall the angels bring mine elect and righteous which are perfect in all uprightness and bear them in their hands and clothe them with the raiment of the life that is above They shall see their desire on them that hated them when he punisheth them and the torment of every one shall be for ever according to his works And all they that are in torment shall say with one voice Have mercy upon us for now know we the judgement of God which he declared unto us aforetime and we believed not And the angel Tatîrōkos shall come and chastise them with yet greater torment and say unto them Now do ye repent when it is no longer the time for repentance and nought of life remaineth And they shail say Righteous is the judgement of God for we have heard and perceived that his judgement is good for we are recompensed according to our deeds Then will I give unto mine elect and righteous the washing and the salvation for which they have besought me in the field of Akrosja which is called Anēslaslejā They shall adorn with flowers the portion of the righteous and I shall go I shall rejoice with them I will cause the peoples to enter in to mine everlasting kingdom and show them that eternal thing whereon I have made them to set their hope even I and my Father which is in heaven I have spoken this unto thee Peter and declared it unto thee Go forth therefore and go unto the land of the west And my Lord Jesus Christ our king said unto me Let us go unto the holy mountain And his disciples went with him praying And behold there were two men there and we could not look upon their faces for a light came from them shining more than the sun and their raiment also was shining and cannot be described and nothing is sufficient to be compared unto them in this world And the sweetness of them that no mouth is able to utter the beauty of their appearance for their aspect was astonishing and wonderful †And the other great I say† shineth in his aspect above crystal Like the flower of roses is the appearance of the colour of his aspect and of his body his head And upon his shoulders and on their foreheads was a crown of nard woven of fair flowers As the rainbow in the water so was their hair And such was the comeliness of their countenance adorned with all manner of ornament And when we saw them on a sudden we marvelled And I drew near unto the Lord Jesus Christ and said unto him O my Lord who are these And he said unto me They are Moses and Elias And I said unto him Where then are Abraham and Isaac and Jacob and the rest of the righteous fathers And he showed us a great garden open full of fair trees and blessed fruits and of the odour of perfumes The fragrance thereof was pleasant and came even unto us And thereof saw I much fruit And my Lord and God Jesus Christ said unto me Hast thou seen the companies of the fathers As is their rest such also is the honour and the glory of them that are persecuted for my righteousness sake And I rejoiced and believed and understood that which is written in the book of my Lord Jesus Christ And I said unto him O my Lord wilt thou that I make here three tabernacles one for thee and one for Moses and one for Elias And he said unto me in wrath Satan maketh war against thee and hath veiled thine understanding and the good things of this world prevail against thee Thine eyes therefore must be opened and thine ears unstopped that thou mayest see a tabernacle not made with men’s hands which my heavenly Father hath made for me and for the elect And we beheld it and were full of gladness And behold suddenly there came a voice from heaven saying This is my beloved Son in whom I am well pleased he hath kept my commandments And then came a great and exceeding white cloud over our heads and bare away our Lord and Moses and Elias And I trembled and was afraid and we looked up and the heaven opened and we beheld men in the flesh and they came and greeted our Lord and Moses and Elias and went into another heaven And the word of the scripture was fulfilled This is the generation that seeketh him and seeketh the face of the God of Jacob And great fear and commotion was there in heaven and the angels pressed one upon another that the word of the scripture might be fulfilled which saith Open the gates ye princes Thereafter was the heaven shut that had been open And we prayed and went down from the mountain glorifying God which hath written the names of the righteous in heaven in the book of life There is a great deal more of the Ethiopic text but it is very evidently of later date the next words are Peter opened his mouth and said to me Hearken my son Clement God created all things for his glory ’ and this proposition is dwelt upon The glory of those who duly praise God is described in terms borrowed from the Apocalypse The Son at his coming will raise the dead and will make my righteous ones shine seven times more than the sun and will make their crowns shine like crystal and like the rainbow in the time of rain which are perfumed with nard and cannot be contemplated with rubies with the colour of emeralds shining brightly with topazes gems and yellow pearls that shine like the stars of heaven and like the rays of the sun sparkling which cannot be gazed upon ’ Again of the angels ‘Their faces shine more than the sun their crowns are as the rainbow in the time of rain with nard Their eyes shine like the morning star The beauty of their appearance cannot be expressed Their raiment is not woven but white as that of the fuller according as I saw on the mountain where Moses and Elias were Our Lord showed at the transfiguration the apparel of the last days of the day of resurrection unto Peter James and John the sons of Zebedee and a bright cloud overshadowed us and we heard the voice of the Father saying unto us This is my Son whom I love and in whom I am well pleased hear him And being afraid we forgat all the things of this life and of the flesh and knew not what we said because of the greatness of the wonder of that day and of the mountain whereon he showed us the second coming in the kingdom that passeth not away Next The Father hath committed all judgement unto the Son The destiny of sinners—their eternal doom—is more then Peter can endure he appeals to Christ to have pity on them And my Lord answered me and said to me Hast thou understood that which I said unto thee before It is permitted unto thee to know that concerning which thou askest but thou must not tell that which thou hearest unto the sinners lest they transgress the more and sin Peter weeps many hours and is at last consoled by an answer which though exceedingly diffuse and vague does seem to promise ultimate pardon for all My Father will give unto them all the life the glory and the kingdom that passeth not away It is because of them that have believed in me that I am come It is also because of them that have believed in me that at their word I shall have pity on men The doctrine that sinners will be saved at last by the prayers of the righteous is rather obscurely enunciated in the Second Book of the Sibylline Oracles and in the Apocalypse of Elias ",

"STORY_OF_JOSEPH STORY OF JOSEPH OF ARIMATHAEA I I Joseph of Arimathaea who begged the body of the Lord Jesus from Pilate was imprisoned by the Jews on that account These are the people who provoked their lawgiver Moses and failing to recognize their God crucified his Son Seven days before the passion of Christ two condemned robbers were sent from Jericho to Pilate whose crimes were these The first Gestas used to strip and murder wayfarers hang up women by the feet and cut off their breasts drink the blood of babes he knew not God nor obeyed any law but was violent from the beginning The other Demas was a Galilaean who kept an inn he despoiled the rich but did good to the poor even burying them like Tobit He had committed robberies on the Jews for he stole the law itself at Jerusalem and stripped the daughter of Caiaphas who was a priestess of the sanctuary and he took away even the mystic deposit of Solomon which had been deposited in the place Jesus also was taken at even on the third day before the passover But Caiaphas and the multitude of the Jews had no passover but were in great grief because of the robbery of the sanctuary by the thief And they sent for Judas Iscariot who was brother s son to Caiaphas and had been persuaded by the Jews to become a disciple of Jesus not to follow his teachings but to betray him They paid him a didrachm of gold daily and as one of Jesus disciples called John says he had been two years with Jesus On the third day before Jesus was taken Judas said to the Jews Let us assemble a council and say that it was not the robber who took away the law but Jesus Nicodemus who had the keys of the sanctuary said No for he was a truthful man But Sarra Caiaphas daughter cried out that Jesus said in public I can destroy the temple All the Jews said We believe you For they held her as a prophetess So Jesus was taken II On the morrow being Wednesday at the ninth hour they brought him into Caiaphas hall and Annas and Caiaphas asked him Why didst thou take away the law He was silent Why wouldst thou destroy the temple of Solomon He was silent In the evening the multitude sought the daughter of Caiaphas to burn her with fire because the law was stolen and they could not keep the passover But she said Wait a little my children and let us destroy Jesus and the law will be found and the feast kept Then Annas and Caiaphas privily gave gold to Judas and said Say as you said before that it was Jesus who stole the law Judas agreed but said The people must not know that you have told me this and you must let Jesus go and I will persuade them So they fraudulently let Jesus go At dawn of the Thursday Judas went into the sanctuary and said to all the people What will ye give me if I deliver to you the destroyer of the law and robber of the prophets They said Thirty silver pieces of gold But they did not know that it was Jesus of whom he spoke for many thought him to be the Son of God And Judas received the thirty pieces At the fourth and fifth hours he went out and found Jesus walking in the street Towards evening he obtained a guard of soldiers As they went Judas said Whomsoever I shall kiss take him he it is that stole the law and the prophets He came to Jesus and kissed him saying Hail Rabbi They took Jesus to Caiaphas and examined him Why didst thou do this but he answered nothing Nicodemus and I left the seat of the pestilent and would not consent to perish in the council of sinners Ill They did many evil things to Jesus that night and on the dawn of Friday delivered him to Pilate He was condemned and crucified with the two robbers Gestas on the left Demas on the right He on the left cried out to Jesus See what evils I have wrought on the earth and had I known thou wert the king I would have killed thee too Why callest thou thyself Son of God and canst not help thyself in the hour of need or how canst thou succour any other that prayeth if thou be the Christ come down from the cross that I may believe thee But now I behold thee not as a man but as a wild beast caught and perishing along with me And much else he spake against Jesus blaspheming and gnashing his teeth upon him for he was caught in the snare of the devil But Demas on the right seeing the divine grace of Jesus began to cry out thus I know thee Jesus Christ that thou art the Son of God I see thee Christ worshipped by ten thousand times ten thousand angels forgive my sins that I have committed make not the stars to enter into judgement with me or the moon when thou judgest all the world for in the night did I work my evil plans stir not up the sun that now is darkened for thy sake to tell the evil of my heart for I can give thee no gift for remission of sins Already death cometh on me for my sins but pardon belongeth unto thee save me Lord of all things from thy terrible judgement give not power unto the enemy to swallow me up and be inheritor of my soul as of his that hangeth on the left for I see how the devil taketh his soul rejoicing and his flesh vanisheth away Neither command me to depart into the lot of the Jews for I see Moses and the patriarchs weeping sore and the devil exulting over them Therefore before my spirit departeth command O Lord that my sins be blotted out and remember me the sinner in thy kingdom when thou sittest on the great throne of the Most High and shalt judge the twelve tribes of Israel for thou hast prepared great punishment for thy world for thy sake And when the thief had so said Jesus saith unto him Verily verily I say unto thee Demas that to day thou shalt be with me in paradise but the sons of the kingdom the children of Abraham Isaac and Jacob and Moses shall be cast out into the outer darkness there shall be weeping and gnashing of teeth But thou only shalt dwell in paradise until my second coming when I shall judge them that have not confessed my name And he said to the thief Go and say unto the cherubim and the powers that turn about the flaming sword that keep the garden since Adam the first created was in paradise and transgressed and kept not my commandments and I cast him out thence—but none of the former men shall see paradise until I come the second time to judge the quick and dead—And he wrote thus Jesus Christ the Son of God that came down from the heights of heaven that proceeded out of the bosom of the invisible Father without separation and came down into the world to be incarnate and to be nailed to the cross that I might save Adam whom I formed unto my powers the archangels that keep the doors of paradise the servants of my Father I will and command that he that is crucified with me receive remission of his sins for my sake and being clothed with an incorruptible body enter in to paradise and that he dwell there where no man else is ever able to dwell And when this was said Jesus gave up the ghost on Friday at the ninth hour And there was darkness over all the land and a great earthquake so that the sanctuary fell and the pinnacle of the temple IV And I Joseph begged the body and laid it in my new tomb The body of Demas was not found that of Gestas was in appearance like that of a dragon The Jews imprisoned me on the evening of the sabbath When it was evening on the first day of the week at the fifth hour of the night Jesus came to me with the thief on the right hand There was great light the house was raised up by the four corners and I went forth and I perceived Jesus first and then the thief bringing a letter to him and as we journeyed to Galilee there was a very great light and a sweet fragrance came from the thief Jesus sat down in a certain place and read as follows The cherubim and the six winged that are commanded by thy Godhead to keep the garden of paradise make known to thee this by the hand of the robber that by thy dispensation was crucified with thee When we saw the mark of the nails on the robber that was crucified with thee and the light of the letters of thy Godhead the fire was quenched being unable to bear the light of the mark and we were in great fear and crouched down For we heard that the maker of heaven and earth and all creation had come to dwell in the lower parts of the earth for the sake of Adam the first created For we beheld the spotless cross with the robber flashing with light and shining with seven times the light of the sun and trembling came on us when we heard the crashing of them beneath the earth and with a great voice the ministers of Hades said with us Holy Holy Holy is he that was in the highest in the beginning and the powers sent up a cry saying Lord thou hast been manifested in heaven and upon earth giving joy unto the worlds and saving thine own creation from death V And as I went with Jesus and the robber to Galilee the form of Jesus was changed and he became wholly light and angels ministered to him and he conversed with them I stayed with him three days and none of the disciples were there In the midst of the days of unleavened bread his disciple John came and the robber disappeared John asked who it was but Jesus did not answer John said Lord I know that thou hast loved me from the beginning why dost thou not reveal this man to me Jesus said Seekest thou to know hidden things art thou wholly without understanding perceivest thou not the fragrance of paradise filling the place knowest thou not who it was The thief that was on the cross is become heir of paradise verily verily I say unto you that it is his alone until the great day come John said Make me worthy to see him Then suddenly the thief appeared and John fell to the earth for he was now like a king in great might clad with the cross And a voice of a multitude was heard Thou art come into the place of paradise prepared for thee we are appointed to serve thee by him that sent thee until the great day After that both the thief and I Joseph vanished and I was found in my own house and I saw Jesus no more All this I saw and have written that all might believe on Jesus and no longer serve Moses law but believe in the signs and wonders of Christ and believing obtain eternal life and be found in the kingdom of heaven For His is glory might praise and majesty world without end Amen ",

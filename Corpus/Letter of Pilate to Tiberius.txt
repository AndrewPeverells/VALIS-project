"LETTER_PILATE LETTER OF PILATE TO TIBERIUS REPORT OF PILATE I have received a communication O most mighty which oppresses me with fear and trembling He goes on to say that in Jerusalem a city of his province the Jews delivered him a man named Jesus charging him with much that they could not substantiate and in particular with violating the sabbath The miracles are then described with some rhetorical ornament particularly in the case of Lazarus Jesus was delivered to him by Herod Archelaus Philip Annas Caiaphas and all the people At his crucifixion the sun was darkened the stars appeared and in all the world people lighted lamps from the sixth hour till evening the moon appeared like blood and the stars and Orion lamented at the sin of the Jews On the first day of the week at the third hour of night there was a great light the sun shone with unwonted brightness men in shining garments appeared in the air and cried out to the souls in Hades to come up and proclaimed the resurrection of Jesus The light continued all night Many Jews disappeared in the chasms which the earthquake had caused and all the synagogues except one fell down Under the stress of the consternation caused by all these portents Pilate writes to Caesar To this is appended in one recension the Delivering up Paradosis of Pilate On receipt of the letter there was great astonishment at Rome and Caesar in wrath ordered Pilate to be brought to him as a prisoner On hearing of his arrival Caesar took his seat in the temple of the gods before all the senate and with all his army and all the multitude of his power and said to Pilate How didst thou dare thou most impious to do such a thing when thou hadst seen such signs concerning that man by thy wicked daring thou hast destroyed the whole world Pilate threw the blame on the Jews on Herod Archelaus Philip Annas and Caiaphas Caesar Why didst thou yield to them Pilate The nation is rebellious and disobedient Caesar Thou oughtest to have kept him safe and sent him to me and not have yielded and crucified one who had done all those mighty works of which thou spakest in thy report It is plain that he was the Christ the king of the Jews When Caesar named Christ all the images of the gods fell down and became as dust There was great consternation Caesar remanded Pilate to prison Next day he sat in the Capitol with all the senate and a dialogue similar to the last took place After it Caesar wrote to Licianus the chief governor of the East bidding him enslave all the nation of the Jews and make them few in number for their wickedness This Licianus did Caesar then commanded a ruler named Albius to behead Pilate He was led forth to death and prayed Number me not among the wicked Hebrews Remember not evil against me or against thy servant Procla which standeth here whom thou didst make to prophesy that thou must be nailed to the cross But pardon us and number us among thy righteous ones A voice from heaven came saying All the generations and the families of the Gentiles shall call thee blessed because in thy days were fulfilled all these things which were spoken by the prophets concerning me and thou also shalt appear as my witness at my second coming when I shall judge the twelve tribes of Israel and them that have not confessed my name The prefect cut off Pilate s head and an angel of the Lord received it whom when Procla his wife saw she was filled with joy and straightway gave up the ghost and was buried with her husband This extraordinarily favourable view of Pilate is characteristic of the East From the same workshop as the Report and the Paradosis come two letters—of Pilate to Herod and Herod to Pilate—which exist in Greek and in Syriac There is some divergence between the two versions ",

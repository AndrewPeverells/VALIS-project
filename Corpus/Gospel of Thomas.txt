"GOSPEL_OF_THOMAS The stories of Thomas the Israelite the Philosopher concerning the works of the Childhood of the Lord I I Thomas the Israelite tell unto you even all the brethren that are of the Gentiles to make known unto you the works of the childhood of our Lord Jesus Christ and his mighty deeds even all that he did when he was born in our land whereof the beginning is thus II This little child Jesus when he was five years old was playing at the ford of a brook and he gathered together the waters that flowed there into pools and made them straightway clean and commanded them by his word alone And having made soft clay he fashioned thereof twelve sparrows And it was the sabbath when he did these things And there were also many other little children playing with him And a certain Jew when he saw what Jesus did playing upon the sabbath day departed straightway and told his father Joseph Lo thy child is at the brook and he hath taken clay and fashioned twelve little birds and hath polluted the sabbath day And Joseph came to the place and saw and cried out to him saying Wherefore doest thou these things on the sabbath which it is not lawful to do But Jesus clapped his hands together and cried out to the sparrows and said to them Go and the sparrows took their flight and went away chirping And when the Jews saw it they were amazed and departed and told their chief men that which they had seen Jesus do III But the son of Annas the scribe was standing there with Joseph and he took a branch of a willow and dispersed the waters which Jesus had gathered together And when Jesus saw what was done he was wroth and said unto him O evil ungodly and foolish one what hurt did the pools and the waters do thee behold now also thou shalt be withered like a tree and shalt not bear leaves neither root nor fruit And straightway that lad withered up wholly but Jesus departed and went unto Joseph’s house But the parents of him that was withered took him up bewailing his youth and brought him to Joseph and accused him ‘for that thou hast such a child which doeth such deeds’ IV After that again he went through the village and a child ran and dashed against his shoulder And Jesus was provoked and said unto him Thou shalt not finish thy course And immediately he fell down and died But certain when they saw what was done said Whence was this young child born for that every word of his is an accomplished work And the parents of him that was dead came unto Joseph and blamed him saying Thou that hast such a child canst not dwell with us in the village or do thou teach him to bless and not to curse for he slayeth our children V And Joseph called the young child apart and admonished him saying Wherefore doest thou such things that these suffer and hate us and persecute us But Jesus said I know that these thy words are not thine nevertheless for thy sake I will hold my peace but they shall bear their punishment And straightway they that accused him were smitten with blindness And they that saw it were sore afraid and perplexed and said concerning him that every word which he spake whether it were good or bad was a deed and became a marvel And when they saw that Jesus had so done Joseph arose and took hold upon his ear and wrung it sore And the young child was wroth and said unto him It sufficeth thee to seek and not to find and verily thou hast done unwisely knowest thou not that I am thine vex me not VI Now a certain teacher Zacchaeus by name stood there and he heard in part when Jesus said these things to his father and he marvelled greatly that being a young child he spake such matters And after a few days he came near unto Joseph and said unto him Thou hast a wise child and he hath understanding Come deliver him to me that he may learn letters And I will teach him with the letters all knowledge and that he salute all the elders and honour them as grandfathers and fathers and love them of his own years And he told him all the letters from Alpha even to Omega clearly with much questioning But Jesus looked upon Zacchaeus the teacher and saith unto hinr Thou that knowest not the Alpha according to its nature how canst thou teach others the Beta thou hypocrite first if thou knowest it teach the Alpha and then will we believe thee concerning the Beta Then began he to confound the mouth of the teacher concerning the first letter and he could not prevail to answer him And in the hearing of many the young child saith to Zacchaeus Hear O teacher the ordinance of the first letter and pay heed to this how that it hath thou hast the rules of the Alpha VII Now when Zacchaeus the teacher heard such and so many allegories of the first letter spoken by the young child he was perplexed at his answer and his instruction being so great and said to them that were there Woe is me wretch that I am I am confounded I have brought shame to myself by drawing to me this young child Take him away therefore I beseech thee my brother Joseph I cannot endure the severity of his look I cannot once make clear my word This young child is not earthly born this is one that can tame even fire be like this is one begotten before the making of the world What belly bare this what womb nurtured it I know not Woe is me O my friend he putteth me from my sense I cannot follow his understanding I have deceived myself thrice wretched man that I am I strove to get me a disciple and I am found to have a master I think O my friends upon my shame for that being old I have been overcome by a young child and I am even ready to faint and to die because of the boy for I am not able at this present hour to look him in the face And when all men say that I have been overcome by a little child what have I to say and what can I tell concerning the lines of the first letter whereof he spake to me I am ignorant O my friends for neither beginning nor end of it do I know Wherefore I beseech thee my brother Joseph take him away unto thine house for he is somewhat great whether god or angel or what I should call him I know not VIII And as the Jews were counselling Zacchaeus the young child laughed greatly and said Now let those bear fruit that were barren and let them see that were blind in heart I am come from above that I may curse them and call them to the things that are above even as he commanded which hath sent me for your sakes And when the young child ceased speaking immediately all they were made whole which had come under his curse And no man after that durst provoke him lest he should curse him and he should be maimed IX Now after certain days Jesus was playing in the upper story of a certain house and one of the young children that played with him fell down from the house and died And the other children when they saw it fled and Jesus remained alone And the parents of him that was dead came and accused him that he had cast him down but they reviled him still Then Jesus leaped down from the roof and stood by the body of the child and cried with a loud voice and said Zeno arise and tell me did I cast thee down And straightway he arose and said Nay Lord thou didst not cast me down but didst raise me up And when they saw it they were amazed and the parents of the child glorified God for the sign which had come to pass and worshipped Jesus X After a few days a certain young man was cleaving wood in the neighbourhood and the axe fell and cut in sunder the sole of his foot and losing much blood he was at the point to die And when there was a tumult and concourse the young child Jesus also ran thither and by force passed through the multitude and took hold upon the foot of the young man that was smitten and straightway it was healed And he said unto the young man Arise now and cleave the wood and remember me But when the multitude saw what was done they worshipped the young child saying Verily the spirit of God dwelleth in this young child XI Now when he was six years old his mother sendeth him to draw water and bear it into the house and gave him a pitcher but in the press he struck it against another and the pitcher was broken But Jesus spread out the garment which was upon him and filled it with water and brought it to his mother And when his mother saw what was done she kissed him and she kept within herself the mysteries which she saw him do XII Again in the time of sowing the young child went forth with his father to sow wheat in their land and as his father sowed the young child Jesus sowed also one corn of wheat And he reaped it and threshed it and made thereof an hundred measures and he called all the poor of the village unto the threshing floor and gave them the wheat And Joseph took the residue of the wheat And he was eight years old when he wrought this sign XIII Now his father was a carpenter and made at that time ploughs and yokes And there was required of him a bed by a certain rich man that he should make it for him And whereas one beam that which is called the shifting one was too short and Joseph knew not what to do the young child Jesus said to his father Joseph Lay down the two pieces of wood and make them even at the end next unto thee And Joseph did as the young child said unto him And Jesus stood at the other end and took hold upon the shorter beam and stretched it and made it equal with the other And his father Joseph saw it and marvelled and he embraced the young child and kissed him saying Happy am I for that God hath given me this young child XIV But when Joseph saw the understanding of the child and his age that it was coming to the full he thought with himself again that he should not be ignorant of letters and he took him and delivered him to another teacher And the teacher said unto Joseph First will I teach him the Greek letters and after that the Hebrew For the teacher knew the skill of the child and was afraid of him notwithstanding he wrote the alphabet and Jesus pondered thereon a long time and answered him not And Jesus said to him If thou be indeed a teacher and if thou knowest letters well tell me the power of the Alpha and then will I tell thee the power of the Beta And the teacher was provoked and smote him on the head And the young child was hurt and cursed him and straightway he fainted and fell to the ground on his face And the child returned unto the house of Joseph and Joseph was grieved and commanded his mother saying Let him not forth without the door for all they die that provoke him to wrath XV And after some time yet another teacher which was a faithful friend of Joseph said to him Bring the young child unto me to the school peradventure I may be able by cockering him to teach him the letters And Joseph said If thou hast no fear my brother take him with thee And he took him with him in fear and much trouble of spirit but the young child followed him gladly And going with boldness into the school he found a book lying upon the pulpit and he took it and read not the letters that were therein but opened his mouth and spake by the Holy Spirit and taught the law to them that stood by And a great multitude came together and stood there hearkening and marvelled at the beauty of his teaching and the readiness of his words in that being an infant he uttered such things But when Joseph heard it he was afraid and ran unto the school thinking whether this teacher also were without skill but the teacher said unto Joseph Know my brother that I received this child for a disciple but he is full of grace and wisdom and now I beseech thee brother take him unto thine house And when the young child heard that he smiled upon him and said Forasmuch as thou hast said well and hast borne right witness for thy sake shall he also that was smitten be healed And forthwith the other teacher was healed And Joseph took the young child and departed unto his house XVI And Joseph sent his son James to bind fuel and carry it into his house And the young child Jesus also followed him And as James was gathering of faggots a viper bit the hand of James And as he was sore afflicted and ready to perish Jesus came near and breathed upon the bite and straightway the pain ceased and the serpent burst and forthwith James continued whole XVII And after these things in the neighbourhood of Joseph a little child fell sick and died and his mother wept sore And Jesus heard that there w as great mourning and trouble and he ran quickly and found the child dead and he touched his breast and said I say unto thee Child die not but live and be with thy mother And straightway it looked up and laughed And he said to the woman Take him up and give him milk and remember me And the multitude that stood by saw it and marvelled and said Of a truth this young child is either a god or an angel of God for every word of his is a perfect work And Jesus departed thence and was playing with other children XVIII And after some time there was work of building And there came a great tumult and Jesus arose and went thither and he saw a man lying dead and took hold of his hand and said Man I say unto thee arise and do thy work And immediately he arose and worshipped him And when the multitude saw it they were astonished and said This young child is from heaven for he hath saved many souls from death and hath power to save them all his life long XIX And when he was twelve years old his parents went according to the custom unto Jerusalem to the feast of the passover with their company and after the passover they returned to go unto their house And as they returned the child Jesus went back to Jerusalem but his parents supposed that he was in their company And when they had gone a day’s journey they sought him among their kinsfolk and when they found him not they were troubled and returned again to the city seeking him And after the third day they found him in the temple sitting in the midst of the doctors and hearing and asking them questions And all men paid heed to him and marvelled how that being a young child he put to silence the elders and teachers of the people expounding the heads of the law and the parables of the prophets And his mother Mary came near and said unto him Child wherefore hast thou so done unto us behold we have sought thee sorrowing And Jesus said unto them Why seek ye me know ye not that I must be in my Father’s house But the scribes and Pharisees said Art thou the mother of this child and she said I am And they said unto her Blessed art thou among women because God hath blessed the fruit of thy womb For such glory and such excellence and wisdom we have neither seen nor heard at any time The Writing of the holy Apostle Thomas concerning the conversation of the Lord in his childhood I I Thomas the Israelite have thought it needful to make known unto all the brethren that are of the Gentiles the mighty works of childhood which our Lord Jesus Christ wrought when he was conversant in the body and came unto the city of Nazareth in the fifth year of his age II On a certain day when there had fallen a shower of rain he went forth of the house where his mother was and played upon the ground where the waters were running and he made pools and the waters flowed down and the pools were filled with water Then saith he I will that ye become clean and wholesome waters And straightway they did so But a certain son of Annas the scribe passed by bearing a branch of willow and he overthrew the pools with the branch and the waters were poured out And Jesus turned about and said unto him O ungodly and disobedient one what hurt have the pools done thee that thou hast emptied them Thou shalt not finish thy course and thou shalt be withered up even as the branch which thou hast in hand And he went on and after a little he fell and gave up the ghost And when the young children that played with him saw it they marvelled and departed and told the father of him that was dead And he ran and found the child dead and went and accused Joseph III Now Jesus made of that clay twelve sparrows and it was the Sabbath day And a child ran and told Joseph saying Behold thy child playeth about the brook and hath made sparrows of the clay which is not lawful And he when he heard it went and said to the child Wherefore doest thou so and profaneth the Sabbath But Jesus answered him not but looked upon the sparrows and said Go ye take your flight and remember me in your life And at the word they took flight and went up into the air And when Joseph saw it he was astonished IV And after certain days as Jesus passed through the midst of the city a certain child cast a stone at him and smote his shoulder And Jesus said unto him Thou shalt not finish thy course And straightway he also fell down and died And they that were there were amazed saying From whence is this child that every word which he speaketh becometh a perfect work But they also departed and accused Joseph saying Thou wilt not be able to dwell with us in this city but if thou wilt teach thy child to bless and not to curse for verily he slayeth our children and every thing that he saith becometh a perfect work V And as Joseph sat upon his seat the child stood before him and he took hold upon his ear and pinched it sore But Jesus looked upon him earnestly and said It sufficeth thee VI And on the morrow he took him by the hand and led him to a certain teacher Zacchaeus by name and said unto him Take this child O master and teach him letters And the other said Deliver him unto me my brother and I will teach him the scripture and I will persuade him to bless all men and not to curse them And when Jesus heard that he laughed and said unto them Ye speak that ye know but I have knowledge more than you for I am before the worlds And I know when the fathers of your fathers were begotten and I know how many are the years of your life And every one that heard it was amazed And again saith Jesus unto them Marvel ye because I said unto you that I know how many are the years of your life Of a truth I know when the world was created Behold now ye believe me not when ye shall see my cross then will ye believe that I speak truth And they were astonished when they heard all these things VII Now Zacchaeus wrote the alphabet in Hebrew and saith unto him Alpha And the young child said Alpha And again the master said Alpha and the young child likewise Then again the third time the master said Alpha Then Jesus looked upon the teacher and said Thou that knowest not the Alpha how canst thou teach another the Beta And the child beginning at the Alpha said of his own accord the two and twenty letters And thereafter saith he Hear O master the ordinance of the first letter and know how many incomings and lines it hath and marks common going apart and coming together And when Zacchaeus heard such designations of the one letter he was amazed and had nothing to answer and turning about he said unto Joseph My brother this child is of a truth not earthly born take him away therefore from me VIII And after these things one day Jesus was playing with other boys upon the top of an house of two stories And one child was pushed down by another and thrown down to the ground and died And the boys which were playing with him when they saw it fled and Jesus was left alone standing upon the roof whence the boy was thrown down And when the parents of the boy that was dead heard of it they ran weeping and when they found the boy lying dead upon the earth and Jesus standing alone they supposed that the boy had been thrown down by him and they looked upon him and reviled him But Jesus seeing that leaped down straightway from the upper story and stood at the head of him that was dead and saith to him Zeno did I cast thee down Arise and tell For so was the boy called And with the word the boy rose up and worshipped Jesus and said Lord thou didst not cast me down but when I was dead thou didst make me alive IX And a few days after one of the neighbours was cleaving wood and did cut off the sole of his foot with the axe and by loss of blood was at the point to die And much people ran together and Jesus came thither with them And he took hold on the foot of the young man that was smitten and healed him forthwith and saith unto him Arise cleave thy wood And he arose and worshipped him giving thanks and cleft the wood Likewise also all they that were there marvelled and gave thanks unto him X Now when he was six years old Mary his mother sent him to fetch water from the spring and as he went his pitcher was broken And he went to the spring and spread out his upper garment and drew water out of the spring and filled it and took it and brought back the water to his mother And when she saw it was amazed and embraced him and kissed him XI And when he came to the eighth year of his age Joseph was required by a certain rich man to build him a bed for he was a carpenter And he went forth into the field to gather wood and Jesus also went with him And he cut two beams of wood and wrought them with the axe and set one beside the other and measured and found it too short and when he saw that he was vexed and sought to find another But Jesus seeing it saith unto him Set these two together so that the ends of both be even And Joseph though he was perplexed concerning this what the child should mean did that which was commanded And he saith again unto him Take firm hold of the short beam And Joseph took hold on it marvelling Then Jesus also took hold of the other end and pulled the end thereof and made it also equal to the other beam and saith unto Joseph Be no more vexed but do thy work without hindrance And he when he saw it was exceedingly amazed and said within himself Blessed am I for that God hath given me such a son And when they departed into the city Joseph told it to Mary and she when she heard and saw the wonderful mighty works of her son rejoiced glorifying him with the Father and the Holy Spirit now and for ever and world without end Amen Here beginneth a treatise of the Boyhood of Jesus according to Thomas I How Mary and Joseph fled with him into Egypt When there was a tumult because search was made by Herod for our Lord Jesus Christ that he might slay him then said an angel unto Joseph Take Mary and her child and flee into Egypt from the face of them that seek to slay him Now Jesus was two years old when he entered into Egypt And as he walked through a sown field he put forth his hand and took of the ears and put them upon the fire and ground them and began to eat Now when they had entered into Egypt they took lodging in the house of a certain widow and abode in the same place one year And Jesus became three years old And seeing boys playing he began to play with them And he took a dried fish and put it into a basin and commanded it to move to and fro and it began to move And again he said to the fish Cast out thy salt that is in thee and go into the water And it came to pass But when the neighbours saw what was done they told it to the widow woman in whose house his mother Mary dwelt And she when she heard it hasted and cast them out of her house II How a Master cast him out of the city And as Jesus walked with Mary his mother through the midst of the marketplace of the city he looked about and saw a master teaching his pupils And behold twelve sparrows which were quarrelling one with another fell from the wall into the lap of the master who taught the boys And when Jesus saw it he laughed and stood still Now when that teacher saw him laughing he said to his pupils in great anger Go bring him hither unto me And when they had brought him the master took hold on his ear and said What sawest thou that thou didst laugh And he said unto him Master see my hand is full of corn and I shewed it unto them and scattered the corn which they are carrying away† in danger† for this cause they fought with one another that they might partake of the corn And Jesus left not the place until it was accomplished And for this cause the master laboured to cast him out of the city together with his mother III How Jesus came out of Egypt And behold an angel of the Lord met with Mary and said unto her Take the child and return into the land of the Jews for they are dead which sought his life So Mary arose with Jesus and they went into the city Nazareth which is in the inheritance of his father But when Joseph departed out of Egypt after the death of Herod he took Jesus into the wilderness until there was quiet in Jerusalem from them that sought the life of the child And he gave thanks to God for that he had given him understanding and because he had found grace before the Lord God Amen or And Mary arose with Jesus and they went unto the city of Capernaum which is of Tiberias unto the inheritance of her father But when Joseph heard that Jesus was come out of Egypt after the death of Herod he took him c or After these things an angel of the Lord came unto Joseph and unto Mary the mother of Jesus and said unto them Taketh he child return into the land of Israel for they are dead that sought the life of the child And they arose and went to Nazareth where Joseph possessed the goods of his father And when Jesus was seven years old there was quiet in the realm of Herod from all them that sought the life of the child And they returned unto Bethlehem and abode there IV What Jesus did in the city of Nazareth It is a glorious work for Thomas the Israelite the apostle of the Lord to tell of the works of Jesus after he came out of Egypt unto Nazareth Hear therefore all of you beloved brethren the signs which the Lord Jesus did when he was in the city of Nazareth as it is said in the first chapter Now when Jesus was five years old there was a great rain upon the earth and the child Jesus walked about therein And the rain was very terrible and he gathered the water together into a pool and commanded with a word that it should become clear and forthwith it did so Again he took of the clay which came of that pool and made thereof to the number of twelve sparrows Now it was the Sabbath day when Jesus did this among the children of the Hebrews and the children of the Hebrews went and said unto Joseph his father Lo thy son was playing with us and he took clay and made sparrows which it was not right to do upon the Sabbath and he hath broken it And Joseph went to the child Jesus and said unto him Wherefore hast thou done this which it was not right to do on the Sabbath But Jesus spread forth his hands and commanded the sparrows saying Go forth into the height and fly ye shall not meet death at any man’s hands And they flew and began to cry out and praise almighty God But when the Jews saw what was done they marvelled and departed proclaiming the signs which Jesus did But a Pharisee which was with Jesus took a branch of an olive tree and began to empty the pool which Jesus had made And when Jesus saw it he was vexed and said to him O thou of Sodom ungodly and ignorant what hurt did the fountain of water do thee which I made Lo thou shalt become like a dry tree which hath neither roots nor leaf nor fruit And straightway he was dried up and fell to the earth and died but his parents carried him away dead and reviled Joseph saying Behold what thy son hath done teach thou him to pray and not to blaspheme V How the people of the city were grieved against Joseph because of that which Jesus did And after some days as Jesus walked with Joseph through the city there ran one of the children and smote Jesus on the arms but Jesus said unto him So finish thou thy course And immediately he fell to the earth and died But they when they saw this wonder cried out saying From whence cometh this child And they said unto Joseph It is not right that such a child should be among us And he departed and took him with him And they said to him Depart out of this place and if thou must be with us teach him to pray and not to blaspheme for our sons are put to death by him And Joseph called Jesus and began to admonish him saying Wherefore blasphemest thou They that dwell in this place conceive hatred against us But Jesus said I know that these words are not mine but thine yet for thy sake I will hold my peace But let them see their own foolishness And straightway they that spake against Jesus were made blind and as they walked to and fro they said Every word that cometh out of his mouth hath fulfillment And when Joseph saw what Jesus had done he took hold on him by his ear in anger but Jesus was vexed and said unto Joseph It sufficeth thee to see me and not to touch me For thou knowest not who I am which if thou knewest thou wouldest not grieve me And albeit I am with thee now yet was I made before thee VI How Jesus was treated by the Master There was therefore a man named Zacheus who heard all that Jesus said unto Joseph and he marvelled in himself and said I have never beheld such a child that spake so And he came near unto Joseph and said to him Thou hast a wise child deliver him to me to learn letters and when he is learned in the study of the letters I will teach him reverently that he become not foolish Joseph answered and said unto him No man is able to teach him but God only Think you that this young child will be the occasion unto us of little torment my brother But when Jesus heard Joseph saying these things he said unto Zacheus Verily O master all things that proceed out of my mouth are true And I am before all men and I am Lord but ye are the children of strangers for unto me is given the glory of them but unto you nothing is given for I am before all worlds And I know how many are the years of thy life and when thou shalt raise that standard whereof my father spake then shalt thou understand that all things that proceed out of my mouth are true But the Jews which stood by and heard the words which Jesus spake marvelled and said Now have we seen such wonders and heard such words from this child as we have never heard neither shall hear from any other man neither from the chief priests nor the doctors nor the Pharisees Jesus answered and said unto them Wherefore marvel ye Do ye think it a thing incredible that I have told you the truth I know when ye were born and your fathers and if I should say more unto you I know when the world was created and who sent me unto you When the Jews heard the word which the child spake they were wroth because they were not able to answer him And the child turned himself about and rejoiced and said I spake unto you a proverb but I know that ye are weak and know not anything Now that master said unto Joseph Bring him unto me and I will teach him letters And Joseph took the child Jesus and brought him to the house where other children also were taught But the master began to teach him the letters with sweet speech and wrote for him the first line which goeth from A unto T and began to flatter him and to teach him but the child held his peace Then that teacher smote the child on the head and when the child received the blow he said unto him I ought to teach thee and not thou to teach me I know the letters which thou wouldest teach me and I know that ye are unto me as vessels out of which cometh nought but sound and neither wisdom nor salvation of the soul And beginning the line he spake all the letters from A even unto T fully with much quickness and he looked upon the master and said But thou knowest not how to interpret A and B how wouldest thou teach others Thou hypocrite if thou knowest and canst tell me concerning A then will I tell thee concerning B But when the teacher began to expound concerning the first letter he was not able to give any answer Then said Jesus unto Zacheus Hearken unto me O master and understand the first letter Give ear unto me how that it hath two lines Now when Zacheus saw that he so divided the first letter he was confounded at such names and at his teaching and cried out and said Woe is me for I am confounded I have hired shame unto myself by means of this child And he said unto Joseph I beseech thee earnestly my brother take him away from me for I cannot look upon his face nor hear his mighty words For this child is able to subdue the fire and to restrain the sea for he was born before the worlds What womb bare him or what manner of mother brought him up I know not O my friends I am astray in my wits I am mocked wretched man that I am I said that I had a disciple but he is found to be my master I cannot overcome my shame for I am old and I cannot find wherewithal to answer him so that I am like to fall into heavy sickness and depart out of the world or go away from this city for all men have seen my shame that a child hath ensnared me What can I answer any man or what words can I speak for he hath overcome me at the first letter I am confounded O ye my friends and acquaintances and I can find neither first nor last to answer him And now I beseech thee brother Joseph remove him from me and take him unto thine house for either he is a sorcerer or a god or an angel and what to say I know not And Jesus turned himself unto the Jews that were with Zacheus and said unto them Now let all them that see not see and let them understand which understand not and let the deaf hear and let them arise which have died by my means and let me call them that are high unto that which is higher even as he that sent me unto you hath commanded me And when the child Jesus ceased speaking all the afflicted were made whole as many as had been afflicted at his word And they durst not speak unto him VII How Jesus raised up a boy Now on a day when Jesus climbed up upon an house with the children he began to play with them but one of the boys fell down through the door out of the upper chamber and died straightway And when the children saw it they fled all of them but Jesus remained alone in the house And when the parents of the child which had died came they spake against Jesus saying Of a truth thou madest him fall But Jesus said I never made him fall nevertheless they accused him still Jesus therefore came down from the house and stood over the dead child and cried with a loud voice calling him by his name Zeno Zeno arise and say if I made thee fall And on a sudden he arose and said Nay Lord And when his parents saw this great miracle which Jesus did they glorified God and worshipped Jesus VIII How Jesus healed the foot of a boy And aft er a few days a certain boy of that village was cleaving wood and smote his foot And when much people came unto him Jesus also came with them And he touched the foot which was hurt and forthwith it was made whole And Jesus said unto him Arise and cleave the wood and remember me But when the multitude that were with him saw the signs which were done they worshipped Jesus and said of a truth we believe surely that thou art God IX How Jesus bare water in his cloak And when Jesus was six years old his mother sent him to draw water And when Jesus was come unto the well there was much people there and they brake his pitcher But he took the cloak which he had upon him and filled it with water and brought it to Mary his mother And when his mother saw the miracle that Jesus did she kissed him and said Lord hearken unto me and save my son X How Jesus sowed wheat Now when it was seed time Joseph went forth to sow corn and Jesus followed after him And when Joseph began to sow Jesus put forth his hand and took of the corn so much as he could hold in his hand and scattered it Joseph therefore came at the time of harvest to reap his harvest And Jesus also came and gathered the ears which he had sown and they made an hundred measures of good corn and he called the poor and the widows and fatherless and gave them the corn which he had gained save that Joseph took a little thereof unto his house for a blessing XI How Jesus made a short beam even with a long one And Jesus came to be eight years old Now Joseph was a builder and wrought ploughs and yokes for oxen And on a day a certain rich man said unto Joseph Sir make me a bed serviceable and comely But Joseph was troubled because the beam which he had made ready for the work was short Jesus said unto him Be not troubled but take thou hold of this beam by the one end and I by the other and let us draw it out And so it came to pass and forthwith Joseph found it serviceable for that which he desired And he said unto Joseph Behold fashion that thou wilt But Joseph when he saw what was done embraced him and said Blessed am I for that God hath given me such a son XII How Jesus was delivered over to learn letters And when Joseph saw that he had so great grace and that he increased in stature he thought to deliver him over to learn letters And he delivered him to another doctor that he should teach him Then said that doctor unto Joseph What manner of letters wouldest thou teach this child Joseph answered and said Teach him first the letters of the Gentiles and after that the Hebrew Now the doctor knew that he was of an excellent understanding and received him gladly And when he had written for him the first line that is to say A and B he taught him for the space of some hours but Jesus held his peace and answered nothing At the last Jesus said unto the master If thou be verily a master and indeed knowest the letters tell me the power of A and I will tell thee the power of B Then was the master filled with indignation and smote him on the head But Jesus was wroth and cursed him and on a sudden he fell down and died But Jesus returned unto his own home And Joseph enjoined Mary his mother that she should not let him go out of the court of the house XIII How he was delivered unto another master After many days there came another doctor which was a friend of Joseph and said unto him Deliver him to me and I will teach him letters with much gentleness And Joseph said unto him If thou art able take him and teach him and it shall be done gladly And when the doctor received Jesus he went with fear and great boldness and took him rejoicing And when he was come unto the house of the doctor he found a book lying in that place and took it and opened it and read not those things which were written therein but opened his mouth and spake by the Holy Ghost and taught the law and all that stood by hearkened attentively and the teacher sat by him and heard him gladly and entreated him to continue teaching And much people gathered together and heard all the holy doctrine which he taught and the beloved words which proceeded out of his mouth marvelling that he being a little child spake such things But when Joseph heard he was afraid and ran unto the place where Jesus was and the master said unto Joseph Know my brother that I received thy child to teach him and instruct him but he is filled with great grace and wisdom Therefore behold now take him unto thy house with joy because the grace which he hath is given him of the Lord And when Jesus heard the master speak thus he was joyful and said Lo now thou hast well said O master for thy sake shall he rise again who was dead And Joseph took him unto his own home XIV How Jesus made James whole of the bite of a serpent Now Joseph sent James to gather straw and Jesus followed after him And as James gathered straw a viper bit him and he fell to the earth as dead by means of the venom But when Jesus saw that he breathed upon his wound and forthwith James was made whole and the viper died XV How Jesus raised up a boy After a few days a child that was his neighbour died and his mother mourned for him sore and when Jesus heard he went and stood over the child and smote him on the breast and said Child I say unto thee die not but live And immediately the child arose and Jesus said unto the mother of the child Take up thy son and give him suck and remember me But the multitudes when they saw that miracle said Of a truth this child is from heaven for now hath he set free many souls from death and hath saved all them that hoped in him The Scribes and Pharisees said unto Mary Art thou the mother of this child and Mary said Of a truth I am And they said unto her Blessed art thou among women because God hath blessed the fruit of thy womb in that he hath given thee a child so glorious for so great gifts of wisdom we have never seen nor heard in any And Jesus arose and followed his mother But Mary kept in her heart all the great signs which Jesus wrought among the people in healing many that were sick And Jesus increased in stature and wisdom and all that saw him glorified God the Father Almighty Who is blessed for ever and ever Amen All these things have I Thomas the Israelite written and recorded for the Gentiles and for our brethren and likewise many other things which Jesus did which was born in the land of Juda Behold the house of Israel hath seen all these from the first even unto the last even how great signs and wonders Jesus did among them which were good exceedingly And this is he which shall judge the world according to the will of his Father immortal and invisible as the holy Scripture declareth and as the prophets have testified of his works among all the peoples of Israel for he is the Son of God throughout all the World And unto him belongeth all glory and honour everlastingly who liveth and reigneth God world without end Amen ",
